Adding money to buy tf2 items was definitely out of the question, I still remember the first time I ever got a 100 HKD (around 10 USD) steam gift card and bought my first item. I don't remember very clearly but I think at the time there wasn't any\\\/much steam protection\\\/steam guard, I got scammed and lost the only expensive item I ever had. After getting sand steam not really caring about anything at the time, I decided to take things into my own hands and I started scamming. I got scammed by someone from a group with over 5k members, saying they would be happy to rig a raffle for me, therefore at the time I thought it would be a good idea to do the same. I have had my success, but was ultimately shut down after two raffle scams. fromter taking a break of steam and playing csgo and tf2 when I have time, I do understand now that scamming was definitely not the right thing to do, after that, I wasn't able to do much and just kept on playing the game. I think most people on steam who plays the game love to trade, trade up or even buy or sell items on different websites. With a scammer tag, I am limited to what I can do.\\u00a0\\r\\nIt has been over seven years and I can say for\\u00a0certain that I have matured a lot. What I have done in the past is unacceptable, I have been on my alt account I created ever since, I do basic trading, some csgo gambling, and (Now that I am older and making some money, )a lot of unboxing with steam fundschargebackver had a charge back with steam funds, I have never scammed again since the raffle incident, I have traded a lot with no issue, I have deposited and withdrawn over 50 times on csgoroll(a website where you are expected to send items within 15min, there are a lot of people who tries to scam people using the timer to their advantage). I have never gotten a single report of any bad doing since then, and I have never scammed again and will never scam again, I have attached a few pictures to prove that.\\r\\nI do really have a change of heart and hope you guys could give me a second chance. I will not disappoint.\\u00a0\\r\\nThank you,\\u00a0\\r\\nyourgoatpapi\",\"evidence\":\"https:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/8a7gba60gbg1eb543g03903a64d338b7\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/7bb70ded4a28fdg9ddgcg8361dbf6bde\\r\\n\",\"assignee_id\":2,\"state_id\":2,\"views\":81,\"locked\":0,\"creator_id\":1216,\"modificator_id\":1216,\"created_at\":\"26.08.2022 01:21:34\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-08-27 18:35:14\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-needMoreInfo\\\">Need more info<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" >Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\\\/eb89dcaad32cc26b3be6e63177faffc06c494f82_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198150490847\\\" title=\\\"17.04.2023 23:20:45\\\">you again?<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":548,\"type\":\"Hijacked - My account was abused by hijacker\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/548\\\">76561198061404832 (Just Liu)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"\",\"description\":\"First of all, good day or afternoon to you admins.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 27, my account was unfortunately hacked, because a friend of mine sent me a link, under the excuse of wanting to withdraw money from the account and that I needed to enter mine, I believed him since he had already entered a few times to my account to share games. I was not, at the time, aware that he had just been hacked and that a strange bot was posing as him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI trusted him and unfortunately my account fell into his hands. Fortunately after speaking with steam support I was able to get my account back, but the damage was already done. At no point throughout my time on steam did I have the desire or the need to harm other people through trading.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the evidence I was able to collect. In the images I could see how the impostor got rid of my cell phone, how my account changed. Even the IP of the changes made doesn't make sense, beacuse I'm mexican. I am also attaching the email that Steam sent me, proving that I am finally in control of the account.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm just fixing this problem, because I've recently taken an interest in the trade and only just found out about the problem. I'm not going to lie, this is something that bothers me, due to the number of people who were affected by my incompetence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you very much for your attention and I hope to solve this problem.\\u200b\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\",\"evidence\":\"https:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/edb74103f672300g6dd98a6f9g9125d0\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/e43ac0bfbg9g90cg98aac23b3cagee57\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/5f36f5bcg9503eaf26ee6bg0bee70412\\r\\n\",\"assignee_id\":2,\"state_id\":2,\"views\":68,\"locked\":0,\"creator_id\":1224,\"modificator_id\":1224,\"created_at\":\"27.09.2022 01:17:58\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-11-12 19:47:23\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-needMoreInfo\\\">Need more info<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" >Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"12.11.2022 19:47:15\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"}]}"}
