Adding money to buy tf2 items was definitely out of the question, I still remember the first time I ever got a 100 HKD (around 10 USD) steam gift card and bought my first item. I don't remember very clearly but I think at the time there wasn't any\\\/much steam protection\\\/steam guard, I got scammed and lost the only expensive item I ever had. After getting sand steam not really caring about anything at the time, I decided to take things into my own hands and I started scamming. I got scammed by someone from a group with over 5k members, saying they would be happy to rig a raffle for me, therefore at the time I thought it would be a good idea to do the same. I have had my success, but was ultimately shut down after two raffle scams. fromter taking a break of steam and playing csgo and tf2 when I have time, I do understand now that scamming was definitely not the right thing to do, after that, I wasn't able to do much and just kept on playing the game. I think most people on steam who plays the game love to trade, trade up or even buy or sell items on different websites. With a scammer tag, I am limited to what I can do.\\u00a0\\r\\nIt has been over seven years and I can say for\\u00a0certain that I have matured a lot. What I have done in the past is unacceptable, I have been on my alt account I created ever since, I do basic trading, some csgo gambling, and (Now that I am older and making some money, )a lot of unboxing with steam fundschargebackver had a charge back with steam funds, I have never scammed again since the raffle incident, I have traded a lot with no issue, I have deposited and withdrawn over 50 times on csgoroll(a website where you are expected to send items within 15min, there are a lot of people who tries to scam people using the timer to their advantage). I have never gotten a single report of any bad doing since then, and I have never scammed again and will never scam again, I have attached a few pictures to prove that.\\r\\nI do really have a change of heart and hope you guys could give me a second chance. I will not disappoint.\\u00a0\\r\\nThank you,\\u00a0\\r\\nyourgoatpapi\",\"evidence\":\"https:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/8a7gba60gbg1eb543g03903a64d338b7\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/7bb70ded4a28fdg9ddgcg8361dbf6bde\\r\\n\",\"assignee_id\":2,\"state_id\":2,\"views\":56,\"locked\":0,\"creator_id\":1216,\"modificator_id\":1216,\"created_at\":\"26.08.2022 01:21:34\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-08-27 18:35:14\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-needMoreInfo\\\">Need more info<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" >Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\\\/eb89dcaad32cc26b3be6e63177faffc06c494f82_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198150490847\\\" title=\\\"30.09.2022 23:55:45\\\">you again?<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":546,\"type\":\"Hijacked - My account was abused by hijacker\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/546\\\">76561198202151516 (mynamajeff)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"\",\"description\":\"A long time ago when I was sitll in my teens, i was into trading and I was just casually trading some items.
