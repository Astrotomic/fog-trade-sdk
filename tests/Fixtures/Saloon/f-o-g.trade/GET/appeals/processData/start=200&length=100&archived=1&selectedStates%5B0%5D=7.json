I get rejected from sites that deal with selling skins simply because my account is flagged, and I can't even play on the tf2 server my friends frequent because of this.

My personal life took a deep turn and I stepped away from Steam for a very long time (before Steam introduced steam guard authenticator and before I built up my reputation).\\r\\n\\r\\nI [i][b]only recently recovered my account[\\\/b][\\\/i] and the hijacker basically removed all sources of my previous reputation and I can no longer find these sources. The hacker must have found my account data through a third-party and took full control of my account, even scamming some of my online friends who I was not in contact with for some time. He took advantage of my reputation and scammed however many people he did, and it really sucks because I have been inactive for a while. As you can tell, I was banned 1990 days ago and only just decided to submit an appeal when... I tried trading skins-skin son CSGO because I wanted to get back on steam once I turned my life around. The counterparty notified me of my steamrep ban from both SR and FoG, something I have been unaware about for the last 5-6 years. I tried making another trade offering through skins-skins with someone else and they also brought this up. Both people declined my trades and it seems as though this ban has really affected the way of trading nowadays. Any alternate accounts that are tagged on my profile were part of the scammer's system and I believe they were also banned on them around the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately I have no evidence as I have been away from steam for a very long team, I can only say that this ban has been on my account for 1990+ days (something I have only come to realize). If I really wanted to recover a \\\"scamming\\\" account I would have submitted an appeal ages ago, something I have never done.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, I have been away from steam for some time and have only recently got back into it. I can assure you I've never had any intent to scam people and would kindly ask to have this ban removed as I was hijacked.

Now after over 5 years of living life, the experiences and lessons I have learnt have made me realise, the impacts things you do have on others. Now back in 2016 when I commited the stated scam I didn't think about the impact on others and how they would negatively be affected by what I was doing. But now after maturing as a person and living life, it has made me realise that there could of been alot more happening to those affected.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nBack when I was did the scam I was just looking to make myself a quick buck. Thinking it was simple to just copy someones script from Pastebin and edit it for a site used back in day called CSGODouble to send myself someones coins (unsure what they exactly where called on the site.) without them realising. Making it out to seem like a automatic betting\\\/prediction bot. Now for me it semed like there was no harm as it was only just a few coins. But reality is, many people deposited large amounts of skins to the site in exchange for coins. These coins could be gamble in luck for more. But alot of people without alot of money used this site in hopes for getting a bigger balance to bring themselves out of debt or even make a living for that week. By me stealing their coins, I took away any chance of them being able to recieve back what had put in.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nMe conducting this low act had no negative effects towards me, so I thought. After completing the scam by posting it around on Steam and a few other sites. I noticed my profile with the big red cross stating I was banned on SR\\\/FoG. Now back then I didnt think much of it and just went at appealing it in the most 'legitimate' way. Faking that my Steam was hacked and that it wasnt me that had done it. Actual fact was that it was me that VAC banned my account due to getting sick and tired of not getting a higher rank in competetive (Pretty sad idea.) I then instantly regretted my decision to hack and created a Steam ticket which was also the one I used in my FoG ban appeal claming that someone stole my account etc. My FoG appeal was denied to no surprise. By this point I had left the CSGO community with the idea of never returning and that I didn't need it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany years later here I am, more mature and understanding of my wrong doing. Now for me the biggest push for me to appeal this now is that I am once again interested in CSGO. Being stamped with this ban makes it hard for me to trade or even talk to people without being questioned severely, which I do understand I must live with and I completely agree. I just feel that without this ban it would once again open my doors to the endless possibilities on CSGO and the community it has. I understand and take full accountability for my actions back in 2016 and I do sincerely appologies to everyone and anyone that was affected by myself or others that commited the same scam. I just hope with this appeal I am to clear my name to some degree and enjoy CSGO once again to the full potiential. I love everything about the game but this one hicup has really ruined it for myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope that you are able to see my true change of heart and how sorry I to what I commited. I am more than happen to provide any neccesary evidence and answer any and every question in regards to this in order for me to lift this ban. I know all my past does make me look like a bad person with no morals or ethics but I promise you, the person I am today does reflect what I once was.\\r\\n\\r\\nI appreciate you reading this and if you have any questions please. Happy to answer them all.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegards,\\r\\nJax.\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":129,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":187,\"modificator_id\":187,\"created_at\":\"10.02.2022 06:34:07\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-02-10 20:31:10\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\\\/63006203b71079aa3af586e8152215b3f0567ad3_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198013770396\\\" title=\\\"10.02.2022 20:31:03\\\">n0:name<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":538,\"type\":\"Missing - Evidence is missing or not enough\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/538\\\">76561198035218554 (Michael Burry Jr.)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"\",\"description\":\"[b]To whom this may regard[\\\/b],\\r\\n\\r\\nSo to start things off, I\\u00a0[u]used to do cash trading on TF2[\\\/u].

My personal life took a deep turn and I stepped away from Steam for a very long time (before Steam introduced steam guard authenticator and before I built up my reputation).\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\u00a0[i][b]only recently recovered my account[\\\/b][\\\/i]\\u00a0and the hijacker basically removed all sources of my previous reputation and I can no longer find these sources. The hacker must have found my account data through a third-party and took full control of my account, even scamming some of my online friends who I was not in contact with for some time. He took advantage of my reputation and scammed however many people he did, and it really sucks because I have been inactive for a while. As you can tell, I was banned 1990 days ago and only just decided to submit an appeal when... I tried trading skins-skin son CSGO because I wanted to get back on steam once I turned my life around. The counterparty notified me of my steamrep ban from both SR and FoG, something I have been unaware about for the last 5-6 years. I tried making another trade offering through skins-skins with someone else and they also brought this up. Both people declined my trades and it seems as though this ban has really affected the way of trading nowadays. Any alternate accounts that are tagged on my profile were part of the scammer's system and I believe they were also banned on them around the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately I have no evidence as I have been away from steam for a very long team, I can only say that this ban has been on my account for 1990+ days (something I have only come to realize). If I really wanted to recover a \\\"scamming\\\" account I would have submitted an appeal ages ago, something I have never done.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, I have been away from steam for some time and have only recently got back into it. I can assure you I've never had any intent to scam people and would kindly ask to have this ban removed as I was hijacked.

There was a previous appeal case for this, and I completely forgot to respond as I was caught up with work. I recently invested a lot of money back into the trading community and can't make any trades as a result of this \\\"scammer\\\" tag from both FoG and Steamrep.

At the time I was a kid myself and held no value for money or such things like this it was wrong of me to \\\"lend\\\" the knife from him to begin with and not returning it. I have spoken to Thundric not long ago and apologised to him myself for doing this. I was just wondering if I could appeal the tag as it has been a very long time and I have changed since then and would be nice to not have a scammer tag on my profile for something that happened as a kid. Me and Thundric was friends at the time and it was a shameless thing to do to someone I played with often. I'm hoping for some sort of resolve from this. It would be nice to not have the tag linger on my profile in case I ever decicde to do future trading.I can only say I have moved on from such behaviour and would appreciate a chance to be considered for an appeal.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe link to the report is at the top as I can't put it in evidence and it won't submit without any so I have posted the chat logs from the report as files.\",\"evidence\":\"https:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/defb67b98cfecdgb151957g24c9e2ef1\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/9ac93670f513ea7aa9bfge48e357a47a\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/gca700c551ff893dfaa3fafg4fbf5674\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/10868f7c9f4fgb4b5adafcg82bec2bda\\r\\n\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":66,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":1205,\"modificator_id\":1205,\"created_at\":\"22.06.2022 01:50:46\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-09-27 00:43:09\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"27.09.2022 00:43:05\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":544,\"type\":\"Change of Heart\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/544\\\">76561198206103620 (tf2 irl)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"| steamname: coolandgood\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:360965872]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:0:180482936\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198321231600\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/2006HondaCRV\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198321231600\\r\\n\\r\\n| steamname: Pumbaa\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:323618655]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:1:161809327\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198283884383\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198283884383\\r\\n\\r\\n| steamname: tf2 irl\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:245837892]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:0:122918946\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198206103620\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/69697969654786M\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198206103620\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"description\":\"Nearly seven years ago, I attempted a scam and got a SR ban from Fortress of Gamers. I then tried to appeal very shortly after my ban and lied about attempting the scam since I was still a stupid kid and obviously, that appeal was denied.

I used this alt for nothing except scrap.tf, marketplace.tf, trade bots, and things like that for 6 years until it was marked as my alt suddenly a few months ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nI regret attempting that scam as I said, and I also regret any times I might have been rude or ignorant to any steamrep admins in the past. As I said I was a stupid child, and honestly now I just want to buy TF2 items and use scrap.tf again. I did not actually successfully scam the person, so I cannot repay anything, but I did not attempt any other scams besides that one and I am not going to ever again. If my bans for my accounts could be downgraded or removed I would really appreciate that, as it's been so long and I really just want to move past all of this.

that.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo why should I be unbanned? well, it was a very dumb thing to do and I admit that I was 13 at the time so I've had a lot to reflect and I'm changed. Trading isn't something I really do anymore on TF2 or CSGO.

I was 13 years old and had little regard for moral values at the time, now I am 21.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to start by saying that at the time that I made my previous post, I was under alot of stress and going through depression at the time and the thought of being tagged as a scammer irritated me and didnt really go into detail but I am a more confident person now and willing to just accept the results of the appeal. What had happen was the day I got tagged I was approached by a scammer trying to scam my items by making a trade offer and pasting something along the lines of \\\"there are 100$ in this account and will activate upon you accepting the trade offer\\\", basically steam wallet scamming. So the genius that I was, I copied the text that he\\\/she tried to scam me with and started trying to scam multiple people. I want to note that was my first and last time trying to scam anyone and what I did was look at their inventory pick a nice looking item and paste the scam text completely disregarding moral values as I was looking for a cool cosmetic for my character. I thankfully never managed to steal anything from anyone. I also want to note again that I have never tried to scam since that day. So basically the day I started trying to scam I got tagged for it (deserved). I would love to start playing some tf2 again while being able to use some other websites for trading like I've been doing with warframe.market for the past 3-4 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sincerely appreciate you viewing my post and I hope you review it a second time and give me a second chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch love.\\r\\n\\u00a0\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":51,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":1021,\"modificator_id\":1021,\"created_at\":\"28.06.2023 18:14:12\",\"updated_at\":\"2023-06-28 23:07:29\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/avatars.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\\\/63006203b71079aa3af586e8152215b3f0567ad3_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198013770396\\\" title=\\\"28.06.2023 23:07:26\\\">n0:name<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"}]}"}
