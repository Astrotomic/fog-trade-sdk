That being worth kinda a lot meant people adding me to trade me. This one guy came along and asked if he could trade with me and so I accepted and we started talking. So and so happened that I realized I was being scammed and I even lost my account to him. I found out from my friend that he was impersonating a large trader that I had no idea of. So I didn't have access to my account, my items, or anything. My friend from school went to check on my account for me and he saw that it was being used to impersonate another big trader. This worried me as I knew I would obviously get trade banned soon to some extent so I tried to get it back. I messaged my older brother who helped contact steam for me which allowed him to change the password keeping the scammer out. I got my account back but I was marked as a scammer. Since I was really into trading, this upset me because I had lost all my items to this scammer and I'm most likely not going to be trusted on most trading sites. Hopefully the evidence I can provide below will suffice. The evidence is the account that impersonated someone by the name of Mr.Omani and seeing that hes been trade banned.

At the time, I did not even know how to do trades, and I tried to lie to people, so I should earn more cosmetics. I was not smart at all the time I started doing trades, and I tried to deceive other people stupidly and childishly. And I admit, I did scam in a disgusting way and did not respect other people. After a long time of Trades,\\r\\nSomeone came over to me and took away all the items and Unusuals I had, the ones I earned for myself, and the ones I earned because of my Scams. And it felt so terrible to me, but I felt I deserved it. I lost around the 150 Keys, it hurt me a lot, but inside I felt I deserved it.\\r\\nAnd I really regret all the scams I did,\\r\\nIf only I could turn back time and not do what I did. so it was the best day for me in a long time. I'm really sorry for what I did. I wish I could fix what I did. But that was almost two years ago. And I can do nothing but express a deep regret.\\u00a0\\r\\n[b]I really would like my CAUTION TAG to be deleted. I really want to start a new way in trading, and I promise I will never do something bad or take advantage of anyone for tf2 items, I'm really sorry about everything and I promise to change, although it happened a long time ago when I remembered it really felt bad to me.[\\\/b]\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":123,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":764,\"modificator_id\":764,\"created_at\":\"11.09.2018 21:41:31\",\"updated_at\":\"2018-09-11 22:26:39\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"11.09.2018 22:26:35\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":350,\"type\":\"Hijacked - My account was abused by hijacker\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/350\\\">76561198085657004 (BaN 3)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"| steamname: BaN\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:302821160]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:0:151410580\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198263086888\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/BanChill\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198263086888\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| steamname: BaN 2\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:197994585]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:1:98997292\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198158260313\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/Ban2Ban\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198158260313\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"description\":\"Hello There, my name is BaN and it appears that my oldest account has been hijacked by another user on this site.

of these archived names or in the ajax file have i found the name\\u00a0\\\"|CSGOJackpot.com|Giveaway|Manager\\\" which is one of the names flagged, also the name\\u00a0\\\"-=ST=-Enstage\\\" appears without the \\\"-= =-\\\" which is a minor detail but the evidence the user provided does contain it and also i have no memory of ever meeting the user\\u00a0-=ST=-Enstage or changing my name to his

keep in mind that this happened about a year and a half ago and i'm not presenting my defense because i remember but because i investigated and found evidence against my ban so please if i am proved to be wrong allow me another chance to defend myself. *** Any other names that you see that might be offensive or racist were all used for comedic purposes, although not in very good taste, they are

I didnt know about this until I had my account back (I was on vacation and my friend said he would take care of my account with trading and all that because I had no internet there, theres more info about this below) I agreed and he got on and started to do shady things. I did not think he would be scamming people and I thought he was doing me a favor.) I didn't mention all this before because I thought it had no real value considering I was still marked as a \\\"scammer\\\"and thought I had no real chance of it being revoked. (and because someone said I needed to be on the main account to appeal but it has been inactive for over a year now and im not friends with that person anymore.. so I can't really appeal on his account). Now, he didn't grab any items from anybody from my account which is what I can see (Maybe on his CursedSmoke account?) and I do greatly regret what he did but I understand that it was my fault for letting him into my account and that was a huge mistake that I cannot take back. It has been a couple years now and I have for sure learned my lesson of letting people into my account and that it has never happened since then. I am more mature and more knowledgable now than I was a couple years back and im confidant I can make a positive impact on the community like I once did. I do believe in second chances, maybe I can get one as well?\\r\\n[u][i][b]Regarding my last appeal -[\\\/b][\\\/i][\\\/u] I did say \\\"I\\\" was the one who did \\\"try to scam the other players\\\" which was false. I thought because it was my account I had to take the responsibility (which I did) and I took the entire blame for it. realizing this now, I should have said the entire truth which is what I did in this appeal. CursedSmoke is no longer my friend for various reasons and for betraying my trust which is the most important thing to me, I do know that it was the wrong decision to let him into my account.\\u00a0I also don't know if you can re-appeal so please forgive me if this is a bothersome thing for you.\\r\\n[u][i][b]Regarding the \\\"lending\\\" of my account -[\\\/b][\\\/i][\\\/u]\\u00a0if you're getting into serious trades within games (Like tf2 and csgo) with people and have no internet and you can gain profit while being away on vacation.. that would be a good thing no? Many people do that EXPECTING the person on his\\\/her account to behave and be good. I thought about this for a good while (about a week before I went on vacation) and my past self (14 years young) thought it would be a good idea, (He was a good trader and I thought he could get me up more) but it turned out terrible as im in the position here now. There also was no steam mobile back then so I didn't have that as a option as well, and within the growing economy no one wanted to be behind on anything.\\r\\nI hope you can understand now what actually happened and if you have further questions, let me know!\\r\\nP.S. Thanks for reading all of this, I know its a handful to read. I dont know if you can check IP's but im guessing this is how you ban people, you can see that we have different IP's and are in no way assosiated with each other.

I am willing to ammend broken bonds any way possible. I mean I'd even do a parole type thing if it came down to it. I don't want this to sound memey or dumb by any means it is a completely serious deal.

My most recent trade not being through a friend was May 29th, 2017 and it was an average trade, paid in items for a Circling Heart Killers Kabuto.

Honestly, I forgot about this ban until recently when I wasnt allowed to trade on scrap.tf when I wanted to trade some scrap for items. I remembered about my ban and I really want it removed because it was over 500 days ago (I was 13 at the time) and it was over something really stupid like impersonating a middleman and opskins bots. With that, I wish to apologise for not managing to reply in time for my first appeal and for any trouble I caused. I will attach my trade history over the past year as proof of my change of heart because I have barely traded AT ALL since my ban and I want to prove that I never scammed anyone at all. I have some more valuable items in my old trades but they should add up in the end. Lastly, I have barely even been online on my high level account for the past few months and I virtually NEVER use it.

I also had involved an innocent person in the process. Overall, the entire event was just very childish and dumb of me. I shouldn't have scammed my friend, nor should have I blamed it on someone else.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't trade at all nowadays, but I do plan on moving to this account at some point in the future, and if I were to start trading once again, it would look bad in someone else's eyes if they were to see that I was banned for scamming someone. I honestly do regret scamming my friend, even if he didn't hate me afterwards or anything, it still leaves a sad thought that I could have done that to someone that I knew, anyways I digress.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do believe I have learned my lesson, as I have paid the person who I scammed back in full amount. I don't exactly have screenshots as I have moved computers since what happened, and I believe the person that I scammed sent screenshots to the person who reviewed the original SteamRep tag post. Here is the link to the original post:\\u00a0https:\\\/\\\/forums.f-o-g.eu\\\/threads\\\/steamrep-tag-removal-downgrade-ban-appeal-snbi.12184\\\/.

I have now grown to love the game and respect people with skins a lot more and have experienced attempted scam on myself as well. This ban has stopped me from using cs.money which is a site I used quite often before they started banning people from using it if they have a FOG ban.

This time it is for real. I like to apologize for my four year old appeal as it was very immature and unprofessional. I apologize greatly for my actions towards the trading community. The reason why I started scamming was because I was very upset when I got scammed out of a 50 key valued unusual. It put me in a very sad state\\u00a0for a few months and I stopped playing TF2 as a whole. I came back months later and tried figuring out ways to scam other players. After doing it, It just made me feel worse. I made an idiotic decision of trading my scammed items for CSGO items and gambled it all away on a site called \\\"CSGOPOLYGON\\\". I lost hundreds of dollars worth of items on other gambling sites and it made me very sad. I was diagnossed with anxiety and depression and I now take anit depressants. However, it still doesnt excuse for my actions. I am so sorry to the person that reviewed my last appeal for my foolish behavior and I realise now that it is the scammers falt, not the victum. I was a 12 year old kid that didn't know any better. I want a fresh start and I want to move away from my old evil ways.

He then claimed he wasn't the real admin and that he didn't have my skins, even though the steamrep admin link went to his profile and entire inventory was full of expensive skins including mine now!

Even as a non-trader, it would be bad to continue to hold this reputation moving foreward. It was unclear to me whether or not I remain eligible to appeal, so I think this will be my final attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\n[b]What happened?[\\\/b]\\r\\nI do not remember exactly when, but years ago I had tried to impersonate a middleman. There is no good excuse for attempting to impersonate a middleman. I do recall having the intention of gaining items through scamming people, although I never once did participate in requesting items from anybody, nor did I attempt to be an active middleman in any trades. Still, this is wrong, and I, now matured (albeit seldom), can fully understand why I was reprimanded and banned by FoG from the beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\n[b]Why should I be appealed?[\\\/b]\\r\\nIt has been many years since those days when I attempted to impersonate a middleman. I still hold it true that I did not lie during any of my previous appeals. I did not trade wrongfully; did not ask anyone for items. I did, however, still change my name. I understand that FoG had still obtained substansial evidence to convict me as a scammer, but I continue to think that my application was wrongfully rejected. I think that my original application was misinterpreted, and I hope to convince the moderators of this site that, now, I am able to be trusted as a regular steam player.\\r\\n\\r\\n[b]My apology[\\\/b]\\r\\nOnce again, I was much, much younger when my original banning and appeals transpired. In a wave of anger and foolishness I continued to remake appeals over and over because I thought I had been misunderstood. I personally wish to apologize to any admin who had to deal with the numerous appeals I submitted in my fit\\\/tantrum. I understand if this application is immediately designed as a result of my previous ones, but I hope that the moderators may be able to sympathize with me. I hope that I have not precluded any chance of appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Note\\r\\nI didn't know what to list this appeal under, because I think that it is multiple reasons. Primarily:\\r\\n-Mistake\\\/Admin misunderstood (Not the fault of the admin)\\r\\n-Change of Heart\\r\\n\\r\\nI have no evidence other than my steam profile. The alternate name of the middleman I impersonated has been removed and I now don my own unique profile features. I now have many more hours and the age of my account can be seen.

So this might be my final appeal ever for my ban to be uplifted, if possible.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been nearly 5 years since my ban and I personally have moved on, grown mature and become a better person in life.\\u00a0\\r\\nThe ban had taken place when I was 15 Years old, having improper knowledge of how things in life work. My main to scam some one was because I myself was hacked and lost my TF2 unsuals. However, doing so was the worst decision I made and didn't know what impact it would have on me. So I did scam someone using that fake steam wallet scam. But having done so, and being reported on Steamrep, I returned the guy anything that I had at that time(Mentioned in screenshots below).\\u00a0\\r\\nNow, I haven't traded anything in the past 4-5 years. I want to get back into trading and I was wondering if my ban could be lifted. I jhave no intentions of scamming anyone and the only scam I ever did was because of immaturity and greed. Having grown up, started working and being a lot more educated has taught me a lot and made me become a better person in life. I hope fair decisions by the mod is taken for this final appeal.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there is anything else that is required, please let me know. I really wish if my ban can be lifted so that I can trade again normally. Please take a deeper look for this case as it means a lot to me.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks!\\r\\n\\u00a0\",\"evidence\":\"https:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/9g12a63ga739g336b9bfgaf58fa3e062\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/2ccfd4f128edgb1de891d7d971g614bf\\r\\n\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":714,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":419,\"modificator_id\":419,\"created_at\":\"18.02.2020 07:19:50\",\"updated_at\":\"2020-02-18 08:44:41\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"18.02.2020 08:44:37\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":439,\"type\":\"Change of Heart\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/439\\\">76561198115644413 (Snowball')<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"\",\"description\":\"V\\u00e6r hilset! \\r\\n\\r\\nJeg har v\\u00e6ret forbudt i nogle \\u00e5r siden for '' falske fors\\u00f8g '', mens min konto n\\u00f8jagtigt lignede og anden persons konto. \\r\\n\\r\\nJeg gik tilbage til Steam, og jeg h\\u00e5ndterer virksomheden.

So, to begin my point, i was unaware of my mistake, as i could not tell the difference between Festivized and Festive weapons at the time, which leads my to my next point, which is that i had actually fallen victim to this misrepresentation of Festive and Festivized weapons, as shown in the trade history evidence below (first image). The accuser had claimed that i had STOLEN his items, however, as you can clearly see in the image below, that the trade never went through, as i was banned 595 days ago, which means the date of me \\\"scamming\\\" him would have been around this date, yet i have no history of the trade he claimed in his report went through (second image). And if THAT wasn't enough, he had provided no clear, screenshot EVIDENCE of his items being traded to me. No items were stolen, so i have not scammed him. I understand that i have accidentally mislead this person,\\r\\n\\r\\nAlongside this, i would like to add that i have loyalty to the game \\\"Team Fortress 2\\\" and that i have had a clean trading history, including multiple recent succesful trades, which i shall provide evidence for, which are the rest of the screenshots, showing my recent history of trading, which includes me recently trading off my entire inventory for a discount, aside from a few items.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope that the evidence i have provided is sufficient enough for you to remove my ban from SteamRep, if you have any questions feel free to ask; have a good day.\",\"evidence\":\"https:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/ab49fe5cfdf7ff0gbg961c770f839bbb\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/3gb289442d23eaf0c6826da0a2c571ce\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/fefgg9agc894250a32gb7b4g14e77e35\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/37g10d6c1876gbg0d6e92c7656bfe5e8\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/bd2ffc7dee4gbd0af2040480a10eeb5g\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/gb18dgbef9007cded35gd39b0dff6gde\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/cf206e53052c5af1e06fdf2dgacg7afd\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/a36gd09a5g69a81bg966e8131e12dg5g\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/e0f4cfcad22865ge38dd6b5c96bg20g6\\r\\n\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":173,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":869,\"modificator_id\":869,\"created_at\":\"02.04.2020 04:27:40\",\"updated_at\":\"2020-04-02 04:33:43\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/a1\\\/a128d47f93a1c6377718511a52ddb8d98c155cee_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198065405581\\\" title=\\\"02.04.2020 04:33:34\\\">Enstage<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":452,\"type\":\"Mistake - Admin misunderstood evidence or made a mistake\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/452\\\">76561198344520872 (O PRIMO DELE)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"\",\"description\":\"To my knowledge, I was banned because of inpersonating an admin, called \\\"Alias\\\".\\r\\nBeing honest, I was knew in steam and used to play casual with friends.\\r\\nI was accused of inpersonating when the only thing I did was searching for \\\"anime steam avatar\\\".\\r\\nI oppened the tab in google images and there was it, the image and the name, I just liked it.\\r\\nI never tried to scam someone and in the beggining I had little friends in my steam.\\r\\nI noticed it when I tried to buy skins in cs.money and couldnt cause I was banned in steamreps.\\r\\nI just would like to get an answer because I didnt even noticed untill today, but I remember having that picture.\\r\\nin the anexed files instead of that link was something like a link to the profile and his name, and i just liked it, simple as that\",\"evidence\":\"https:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/f2628af56ea1fg3eg88c1f3d5a6fc098\\r\\n\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":151,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":985,\"modificator_id\":985,\"created_at\":\"05.04.2020 17:58:36\",\"updated_at\":\"2020-04-23 06:02:22\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/a1\\\/a128d47f93a1c6377718511a52ddb8d98c155cee_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198065405581\\\" title=\\\"23.04.2020 06:02:12\\\">Enstage<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":454,\"type\":\"Change of Heart\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/454\\\">76561198183454619 (StewiePlayz)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"\",\"description\":\"Hello,\\r\\n\\r\\nI am Stewart.

Nevertheless, today, upon deciding to revisit the classic game, I was met with a ban decision, which I would like to reverse.\\u00a0 I would like to request, considering the fact that it has been a while since the ban, as well as the maturity having settled in ever since, that the ban be lifted.\\u00a0\\r\\nThank you for your help and understanding,\\r\\nThe Doctor\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":598,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":1006,\"modificator_id\":1006,\"created_at\":\"13.05.2020 20:19:35\",\"updated_at\":\"2020-05-13 20:32:25\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"13.05.2020 20:32:18\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":463,\"type\":\"Change of Heart\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/463\\\">76561198138577717 (AunanJR)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"\",\"description\":\"i was going to trade my skins into cs.money when i realized that i have a ban on me. so me and my frend\\u00a0 searched around to find out why i have gotten a ban. then we found out after getting in contact whit the guy that reported me, that he reported me because i was named \\\"peguin the fluffy\\\" because i won a big pot on csg0 a old betting site, and after the pot i named me \\\"penguin the fluffy\\\" just for troll and i should not named me that. i have never scammed and never going to do. i hope i can get a another chance and proof that i have learnd from my mistake.\\r\\nthe guy that reported met:\\u00a0[url]https:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/fletchs\\\/[\\\/url]\\r\\nthe evidence i got i a piqture of my firend chat on steam with the guy, showed on the piqtures below.\",\"evidence\":\"https:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/8cfd47381g440f56efaaa9f42g9c5efc\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/bfb6e8dc6d65ab31ee9c0a4cf7ed3411\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/662bbf7f9g7ba7b084e30d2cfe664g34\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/e2e275a2137ec85gce766d15e1g6ca8a\\r\\n\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":190,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":1010,\"modificator_id\":1010,\"created_at\":\"19.05.2020 23:12:18\",\"updated_at\":\"2020-05-19 23:13:39\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\">Never<\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":464,\"type\":\"Hijacked - My account was abused by hijacker\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/464\\\">76561198136662495 (Rhino)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"\",\"description\":\"Hello,\\r\\nMy account was hacked a few years ago and I appealed it back then but it didn't go anywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would like to clear my name and reapply for clearing my\\u00a0 ban.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nA hacker took control of my account and spammed links from my account.

About 5 years ago, I played TF2 and ended up resorting to scamming to get items since I couldn't earn income reliably. This of course got me banned. I stopped playing TF2 shortly after, and after half a decade I've decided to pick up the game again. I've matured considerabley since then, and I have no intentions of taking anyones things. I just wanted to buy some items from marketplace.tf, but, I cant, because of my bans on SteamRep.

I personally already had it erased from my head due to various factors, among which the passage of time and the change in mentality.\\u00a0I feel that in its day I rushed appealing said report, although the repentance was there, I do not believe that the 300 days do justice to the acts.\\r\\n\\r\\nI faintly remember what happened that day, so I have reread both the report and the appeal again. The little I remember is the frustration of my 15-year-old self at losing the only weapon I had through the same scam method that I tried to employ in this case. Obviously and I want to make it clear, the action does not justify the facts, so I am more than in agreement with the sanction imposed almost 6 years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this day, I still feel ashamed of my teenage self because I thought the only way to get that money back was to pay an innocent in the same coin. Fortunately, I am left with the peace of mind that I have not achieved this goal or any other related to any type of scam.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have added the alternate accounts I had at the time above as I did with that first appeal, with the difference that to this day those accounts have not been used for years and I doubt that I remember the credentials of any of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sincere apologies on my part for any problem that I could cause in your day although there was no one affected as such by a scam and everything was left in an attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wanted to make it clear that I am willing to collaborate as much as necessary with the moderators to corroborate this change in attitude. Nowadays I cannot go around fooling around and less with a stable job and a life ahead of me, so any data, capture or whatever is required they ask me to provide it without any problem.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nI remain awaiting a response and thank you very much to the moderation for your time and dedication to the community.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreetings, Ander\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":178,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":19,\"modificator_id\":19,\"created_at\":\"18.03.2021 12:08:34\",\"updated_at\":\"2021-03-28 21:48:36\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"28.03.2021 21:48:28\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":500,\"type\":\"Change of Heart\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/500\\\">76561198137885111 (Soiley)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"| steamname: mlger\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:298853892]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:0:149426946\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198259119620\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/MLG360profitmaker\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198259119620\\r\\n\\r\\n(Used only once)\",\"description\":\"Hi, i have been a active member of the steam community for over a bit under 10 years now, ive played many Valve games from HF, to CSGO. My time playing TF2 was not so bright, at the time i had just made my account and i was about 11 or 12. Of course, as all kids at that age i was pretty dumb, had a dumb scam idea (i will link in evidence) that of course wouldn't work out and ended up in me getting banned. At the time of the ban, i reapealed and it got rejected by the community member \\\"Tio Jose das Vacas\\\" and he said i may never reapeal again. As i can see, he is still part of this community and that gives me hope, that we will reconsider his descision. When i got the ban it ruined tf2 for me, i couldnt play much community servers since i automatically got banned. I couldnt trade because people avoided trading with me, so i stopped playing tf2 overall. I wish to try getting my ban removed, since im getting back into TF2 since i got nothing else to do during quarantine, and then remembered i had a ban. I will try to answer any questions as prescise as i can, since it happened 7 years ago and i can't remember much. There was a situation on the last ban appeal where i had to repay the guy i scammed, i will bring screenshots up in evidence.\",\"evidence\":\"Ban Reason: https:\\\/\\\/forums.f-o-g.eu\\\/threads\\\/76561198137885111-admin-xx_gamingtibo_xx.3919\\\/\\r\\n\\r\\nLast Appeal: https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/306\\r\\n\\r\\nScreenshots of me scamming, then repaying the scammed person:\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/1e6000d07df21gg9b906f5c1g234ef27\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/c3e4ef604b82aag7dege0d229d13gd2a\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/20f79df81db4b91ceegb61cbc66e14e6\\r\\n\\r\\nI was later told that it wasn't fully repaid, and i wanted to fully repay, but it seems that he doesnt use this account anymore.\\r\\nUser i scammed: https:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198078195526\\r\\n\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":196,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":635,\"modificator_id\":635,\"created_at\":\"22.03.2021 13:10:41\",\"updated_at\":\"2021-03-28 21:49:59\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\">Never<\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":502,\"type\":\"Change of Heart\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/502\\\">76561198138577717 (AunanJR)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"| steamname: AunanJR\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:178311989]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:1:89155994\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198138577717\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/AunanJR\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198138577717\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"description\":\"sorry for be named\\u00a0\\\"penguin the fluffy\\\" and \\\"i7 jing\\\". here is proof that the names was just for fun and that i dident scam. that my trade log when i was named\\u00a0\\\"penguin the fluffy\\\" and \\\"i7 jing\\\".\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\ni tried to appeal in summer\\u00a0https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/462\\u00a0\\r\\ni dident remember that i was named \\\"i7 jing\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nhere is my steam names last 3 years\\u00a0https:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/AunanJR\\\/namehistory\",\"evidence\":\"\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/05e5d4g12g5egfc8cfg68777ga2b4f8c\\r\\n\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":159,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":1010,\"modificator_id\":1010,\"created_at\":\"20.04.2021 00:23:54\",\"updated_at\":\"2021-04-24 14:15:04\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"24.04.2021 14:15:00\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":506,\"type\":\"Change of Heart\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/506\\\">76561198004520547 (mjaukka)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"| steamname: akka\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:237143742]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:0:118571871\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198197409470\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/akkalv1\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198197409470\\r\\n\\r\\n| steamname: pokes you: xd viss bus laBI!\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:253406347]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:1:126703173\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198213672075\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/gujs\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198213672075\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"description\":\"Hey, I know everyone have one chance to make an appeal, but this scam is almost 6 years old and after I got declined I paid him back .. last appeal he wrote about it but I got declined anyways.
