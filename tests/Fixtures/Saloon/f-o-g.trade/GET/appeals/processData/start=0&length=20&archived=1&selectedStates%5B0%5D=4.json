So I understand that this looked that I was attempting to scam him, but I promise I wasnt. I thought that it would be a funny joke that he would laugh at. Sadly my english was terrible at this time so I found it difficult to explain that to him via trade messages, because of this he thought I was attempting to scam him and he reported me on SteamREP. I am now banned but I promise that the whole thing was a misunderstanding and I would never try to scam someone of their items, and I have never attempted to scam anyone to this day.

What I did 3,5 years ago, as I said before, obviously was a childish mistake which I do still regret of commiting.

I am now almost 16, still play TF2 after 4,7k hours, and love all of the different Communities that this game has to offer. And not for any amount of money would I consider being excluded from one of my favorites, the Trading Community. I trade, I play the game, I create video content and sell SFM content to other users which pay first, make friends, help others with problems and so much more because of my passion for the game. - I hope I made this clear, because I almost cant express what this means to me. [\\\/i]\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, it was a one time incident, and will always be. I tried it on 3 trading servers \\\/ 1 ctf_2Fort server on only 1 single day, and it was luckily not even successful. By no means do I think the tag(s) were unrightfully applied at the time, but given the time passed since (3,5 years), I want to be able to look forwards - not into the past.\\r\\n\\r\\n- ZEG\\r\\n\\r\\n[List of alts: [url]http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198122827281[\\\/url] - [url]http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198156015672[\\\/url] - [url]http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198021823701[\\\/url] ]\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":4,\"views\":199,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":135,\"modificator_id\":135,\"created_at\":\"16.10.2016 12:37:20\",\"updated_at\":\"2016-10-17 20:23:27\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-accepted\\\">Accepted<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/35\\\/35b3bb702713c7447fb32ca27f81fdfb112b13e5_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198031023338\\\" title=\\\"17.10.2016 20:11:41\\\">Ninja Otter With A Taco<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":48,\"type\":\"Wrong Alt - Alternate account is not my account\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/48\\\">76561197992501832 (\\u0122\\u0126\\u01fe\\u06b4\\u0166)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":null,\"description\":\"I have not done anything to scam anyone and the listed alternate account that is on my SteamRep is not my alternate account, I have never scammed anyone ever.

Regarding the \\\"scam\\\" I admit I ran. However I didn't do this for no reason. I had met the victim on an 100% critical hit trade server on tf2. I had played on this server every single day for the past couple months, before I was banned from it of course. I was well known and had never scammed anyone before. This person I did not recognize from ever being on the server and was challenging people to duels. Being scammed before I wanted to make sure this guy was legit. I checked his profile and it said he had limited account, hadn't been on steam that long, yet he items far more expensive than mine. I figured \\\"what the heck, lets do it\\\", I had never gambled before so I started out with the lowest he would go, a specialized killstreak iron bomber kit which was around a key at the time I believe. I wanted to test him though, as a wise person would want to know his opponent before just gambling it away. He accepted but was quite hasty I might add to get to the actual fight. I noticed this person was not that good. He were playing like someone who didn't know how to play. This didn't make sense though, how could someone bad be in possession of good items and yet be offering to duel for them? I was wary but I didn't think much of it. However when the real fight came he was unstoppable. Here lies the reason I fled. I was ignorant in the ways of gambling and in my eyes I had just been played. In my eyes I had seen someone deliberately play bad to fool me into betting better stuff which he would ultimately win. So I \\\"ran\\\" because I felt that it was an unfair and misleading fight and made a poor decision of expressing that. So in conclusion I admit, I lost and I just want to pay my dues to get this curse of being marked off of me. I never meant to scam and never will again but you also shouldn't go around misleading people to lure them in. I just want the victim to know I was wrong but he should know what he did wasn't right either.\\r\\nThank you for your time.\\u200b[\\\/quote]\\r\\n\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":4,\"views\":625,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":149,\"modificator_id\":149,\"created_at\":\"24.10.2016 03:41:58\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-01-02 15:23:37\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-accepted\\\">Accepted<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"02.01.2017 15:23:31\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":85,\"type\":\"Other \\\/ another reason \",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/85\\\">76561198091484062 (SCHMIDT\\u2122)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":null,\"description\":\"For some reason I was banned from TF2 werehouse.
