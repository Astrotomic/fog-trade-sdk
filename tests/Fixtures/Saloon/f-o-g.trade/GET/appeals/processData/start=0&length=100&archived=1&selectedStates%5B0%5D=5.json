Then, because trading era was going to end, items was going down in price and so on, i sent all my skins on main account (this one) and almost forgot about it. But one day friend of my friend wanted to play csgo with us, and sadly he didnt have cs:go account (later i found out that he was vacbanned on his previous account) and i gave him my account. Actually i didnt expect him to do something like this, and i didnt expect that he will basically ruin this account VAC ban, and community ban, when i found this out i was pretty surprised and mad. I asked this guy if he scammed anyone and if he played with cheats, and he said like he never scammed anyone and he was only playing with skinchanger. Anyway i could try to get my account back from him, also i have original email of this account so i could just restore it if he refuse to give it back. Why someone decided that this is my account? Thats easy, i linked my main account in one of my posts, and same from main.\\u00a0\\r\\nWhy do i think the tag should be removed?

I have not attempted a \\\"trade scam\\\" since March. I've decided to go clean.\\u00a0\\r\\nI posted this on FOG and here's my description-\\r\\n\\r\\n[i]Hi, this is Rhythm1C. I was banned on, I believe, March 27th, 2016. The reason was attempting a trade offer scam.\\u00a0If whoever reviews this doesn't know what happened, I sent a bunch of people with an offer for their 5 keys with nothing in return saying it was from my birthday raffle.\\r\\nI was immature and stupid back then and my actions can be described in one word- retarded.\\u00a0\\r\\nI was bitter because I'd lost a big bet while gambling, and a little scared too- I realized I'd lost most of my inventory and wanted to make my inventory back on TF2... I then remembered my YouTube channel \\\"Rhythm1C\\\" and decided to upload a video -my second TF2 video. Id made a lot of money off YouTube so I thought I could make some of I made another video. I got around to recording top 5 scams to watch out for- I was then making the video in haste (I was, an am still a very impatient person) and didn't think anything through. I sent a bunch of people the trade offer scam and was preparing the next, the unusual quick switch when I got a notification that I was banned. I realized how stupid I was after I read my ban appeal.\\r\\nI felt pathetic.\\r\\nWhy had I not thought to ask a friend instead? I'm not sure. Also, being completely honest, I would have given the keys back. I was bracing that if they accepted the fake trade offer, I'd give them back the keys while recording and upload it to my channel.\\u00a0\\r\\nPlease understand- I wanted to create an image of me being authentic and a \\\"gentleman\\\"- so I'd have better reputation when doing steam wallet trades, for example.\\r\\nI had no trouble with this ban after the rejection of my former appeal but since I'm broke again on CS:GO this time, I've decided to start trading, NOT do stupid, potentially ban-able things.\\r\\nTherefore, I plea to remove my ban down to a warning, maybe. I want to have the warning there to make sure I don't do stupid things again.\\r\\nI hope you understand my situation. I am young and feel like I'll make mistakes in the future. I'll need the community to help me out. (I'm 13.) I hope you guys can give me a second chance.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks, Rhythm1C\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S. my name was rhythm1c when I got banned, but I currently use he name \\\"MidKnight\\\".[\\\/i]\\u200b\\r\\n\\r\\n[url]http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/a534e29eab4df9c4fbe3b9g598fe07de[\\\/url]\\u00a0 this was an example of a trade offer I'd sent.\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/www.youtube.com\\\/channel\\\/UCq7_9wHRAF5h2wCYdrSOykw this is my youtube channel.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\",\"evidence\":\"These are the photos of my trade history at that time.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/f00b6gda387b830a9c39a4250c7d05g9 \\r\\n2 2.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/5f00de0cd9bfcbfad35fff4g71411g5c \\r\\n3 3.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/g7a48fc2eacfe3f33be2g8edd47ba636 \\r\\n4 4.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/004bce1c54a7ca33dafcc1gab8b402c8 \\r\\n5 5.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/082g1gd55a92b3acaadf177de02efg2b \\r\\n6 6.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/eec73cf4dg736d62a4dg6gbf7530b93a \\r\\n7 7.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/b775a8g83b3gg3aeag0bab7dd9036119 \\r\\n8 8.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/a9cbccd1ef8df15a0fc83e9891824ed6 \\r\\n9 9.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/9gc89d3da94e6ga7g2dg6d716ecge248 \\r\\n10 10 \\\"scam\\\" attempt http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/eecf8f221gc5f8f7gff181ggd58f8040 \\r\\n11 11\\\"scam\\\" attempt.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/a534e29eab4df9c4fbe3b9g598fe07de \\r\\n12 12 \\\"scam\\\" attempt.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/b5425fgc1c755ac455g6agfg6gba7gff \\r\\n13 13 \\\"scam\\\" attempt.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/ccafd2gc4g8d2eed7191dg5b5ebgc509 \\r\\n14 14 \\\"scam\\\" attempt.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/8f032a4f4c4a98e9g35485fce8a9d0d5 \\r\\n15 15 \\\"scam\\\" attempt.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/e3d9b7gc7f0746fca64018ge2cagg572 \\r\\n16 16 \\\"scam\\\" attempt.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/65d846gged3ag15dbc6bg41g5c831d79 \\r\\n17 17 \\\"scam\\\" attempt.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/0d58eb5de05c847d64eed0a15ce7cgdf \\r\\n18 18 \\\"scam\\\" attempt.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/ccd28gffcd8ccb6aca3ge2agbbdb76e4 \\r\\n19 19.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/a9g76g19bd64cg6g9273gabdbg7ccaef \\r\\n20 20.png http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/9c009ab5e3g4g45acagc2aa81af4021a\\r\\n\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":5,\"views\":402,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":236,\"modificator_id\":236,\"created_at\":\"28.12.2016 14:53:06\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-01-02 18:37:09\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-rejected\\\">Rejected<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/35\\\/35b3bb702713c7447fb32ca27f81fdfb112b13e5_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198031023338\\\" title=\\\"02.01.2017 18:36:17\\\">Ninja Otter With A Taco<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":117,\"type\":\"Other \\\/ another reason \",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/117\\\">76561198111308503 (CaptainWhaleSharks)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":null,\"description\":\"[b]I accidentally reported that charge as fraud to my bank, making a chargeback.

I Argee Most Of The Reports I Did Wrong And I Did This Because I Was Very Poor And Even Through That Is Not An Excuse I Did What I Did Because I Wasn't Growing In The Team Fortress 2 Economy And I Wanted To Grow More. I Use To Spycrab People And Run Away If I Lost. Now I Will Admit I Knew What I Was Doing And I Feel Bad Now Because I Used People For My Gain. Now Recently I Received A Report By Somebody Nammed Vincent Who Clearly Reported Me Under False Context And I Was Very Mad How His Report Went Through Even Though He Had Little To No Proof And He Said I Scammed Him A Key Even Though I Have My Trade History Which Shows I Gave Him The Key 11 Minutes After I Added Him As A Friend. If I Could Figure Out Evidence Or Something I Will Be Able To Prove This To You. Now Almost All My Other Reports Was From 8 Months Ago When My Backpack Was Around 100-200 Ref And I Was Just Trying To Make A Living. Well I Spent Alot Of Money On This Game Recently Just So I Am Able To Become Wealthy Like Those Around Me. Since I Am Quite Wealthy All Those I Scammed From All The Reports I Readded Them And Gave Them A Key. I Screenshoted It And If You Tell Me How To Use Evidence Its On My Google Cloud Account. I Did This So I Am Able To Redeem Myself Hopefully For Scamming Because I Really Want To Join Trade\\\/Unusual Servers Without Being Looked Down At Because I Have The Scammer Tag. This Scammer Tag Really Effects Me Because Recently I Was Force To Sell My 150 Key Unusual Taunt (Square Dance 72 Effect) For Like 70 Keys Because I Could Literally Find No One To Trade With Me Because I Am Banned From So Many Servers. I Feel Like I Learn A Lesson About Scamming And Truely If You Deny This Which I Hope You Do Not Because I Really Want To Not Be Looked Down Towards Because Of This Simple Tag. I Cannot\\\/Do Not Have Any Excuses Other Then I Was In The Wrong And I Relieze That Now. I Made A Group Called Moonmans Prison Cult And In That Group With Around 80 Members I Do Givaways From Keys-Unusuals-Aussies And I Can't Say I Opened This Group Because I Wanted To Do Good. But I Can Say I Opened This Group So I Can Have Friends And Not Be Seen As Some Kind Of Worthless Scammer. Thank You And I Hope You Atleast Reconsider Taking 1 Or 2 Of These Scammer Reports Away.

Have a nice Night \\\/ Day and thanks for the time you spend to see my message. :)\\u00a0\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":5,\"views\":824,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":383,\"modificator_id\":383,\"created_at\":\"20.04.2017 21:43:29\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-04-21 14:39:07\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-rejected\\\">Rejected<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"21.04.2017 14:39:02\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":187,\"type\":\"Change of Heart\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/187\\\">76561198241546842 (\\u3010Y\\u3011\\u3010O\\u3011\\u3010D\\u3011\\u3010A\\u3011)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"\",\"description\":\"Hey.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am truly sorry about my scam incident. The reason why I attempted to scam was because I was scammed $300 via a paypal scam. I was very annoyed and i reported the guy. So on one day I decided to try and scam Fletch. This was my first time ever trying to scam something. It was for a reason though. I wouldn't scam for no reason. After I tried scamming him but never did it and i would never scam one my hearth has changed (you have the screenshots and everything, they are on my steamrep profile) and i admit that but i just want to say it will never happen again I promise you guys with all my heart. I cross my heart none of this will ever happen of me again. I want my steamrep scammer ban gone because I am a trustworthy guy and I usually trade quite often with CSGO items. Every time I want to trade someone I try to be fair and do a simple trade but i get blocked immediately because I'm banned on steamrep. I promise this will never happen again,.

Here is the proof that I am not a scammer and I was actually hijacked.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell this is what happened on December 17, 2015. A guy named nitro adds me leaving a comment on my profile saying that he is looking for HUD testers. So I accepted his friend request and after a little chat on the job he send me a link and tells me that I can download the HUD from there. As soon as I click that link my PC somewhat hangs and steam crashes. I restart my computer and when I re-login in steam. I look for the guy in my friend list. He was not there so I thought that he might have deleted me. After a while the same hang takes place in my computer. I again restart and as soon as I re-login my steam says login error saying that the account does not exist. I go to my neighbour's house and try and login from there and the same message is shown. So I made a new account and used to play on that for a week or so and then I re-login on this account and I somehow enter. I find that 2 new people have added me and they tell me that one of them got scammed by me. They got me banned on outpost without any proof so I tell them that I will return them a particular item they want so that they can get me unbanned. So like a month ago I returned the guy the item he wanted and he instantly blocked and removed although his friend has not. I also have proof of the item that I gave him.

Anyway, on top of all this, this was over a year ago I surely know that's no excuse in itself, but I hope it can be taken into consideration on top of everything else. Please let me know if there's something else I can provide for evidence or to help this whole process.

It's my account:\\u00a0http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/schizzok\\r\\n\\r\\nSorry for coppy\\u00a0appeal, i don't no how change post.\\r\\nHello, I want to write a frank confession. Many years ago, when Steam was for me a usual entertainment and no more, I had friends who boasted of their achievements in trading and catching up on this product. I did not take it seriously. Periodically bought things for the game, and was happy about it. But soon I found out people like scammers. They stole things from me more than 4 times, and it seemed that I knew everything, but they found new tricks and took all my money. I thought this was the way to earn money. Honestly, I got angry with them, and found on the Internet how to \\\"earn\\\" not by fair means. Everything was simple, you had to change the code of the element on a site like csgolounge. You exposed the item cheap, and in the code of the element indicated a different quality, newer. And people just sent exchanges. Then something happened that should have happened sooner or later. I was given a trial period in Steam, and said that I would not do it anymore. I realized that I did not do right. I felt sorry for those people, and myself in the first place ... I immediately stopped deceiving, and began to look for the right ways of trading. I came across a man who taught me everything.\\r\\nAt the moment I trade more than 1.5 years on exchangers, with people I do not have. I really understand how long I've been a bad person for a long time ... I do not know why the days with the lock are 717, because I was so foolish in school, which is more than 4 years ago.\\r\\nI hope you will forgive me, I have understood all my mistakes of the past, and I am not going to commit them any more. I'm just for honest tovlju. Give me one more chance, please.\\r\\nSorry for the bad english, since I use an interpreter.\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S: I'm not exactly sure that these are all my Steam accounts, because for trade and storage of things, I use several at once. Also for the profit from the tournaments cs: go, looking matches from several accounts.\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":5,\"views\":359,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":478,\"modificator_id\":478,\"created_at\":\"23.07.2017 19:10:03\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-07-23 19:44:25\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-rejected\\\">Rejected<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"23.07.2017 19:44:19\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":235,\"type\":\"Change of Heart\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/235\\\">76561198267374455 (M!hnea)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"\",\"description\":\"(my 2nd account is not mine anymore after i made this account it was stolen cause i didnt have the mobile autentificator on and sent a file to a guys with my pass i only played like 1 month on it).\\r\\nThe things was like that.. a guys came to me and said he is a admin on a betting site and he sad he can help me to win a lot of money if i bet my all inventory and after he will make me to win if i give him 20% of my win.

I would like to thank F.O.G once again for taking my appeal and everyones elses appeals from Lethal Zone as we have been despertly waiting.

Therefore the only two accounts that I still have active too are the ones I linked in the Alternative accounts box.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy memory isnt to fresh as this happened 1 year ago when I was 13 (Now 15) so I hope you guys can give me another shot... I miss going on trade servers and going on reddit but once again I think my punishment was rightfully deserved.\\r\\n\\r\\n[b]MY APPEAL[\\\/b]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0First and Foremost I do admit to the scam that I have been convicted of. I do regret my decision of scamming him in the first place, and that is way I gave everything back that I took 2 weeks later. I do have a reason for why I scammed him in the first place later in this appea I will get to that \\u00a0l. I hope you will give me a chance to redeem my self and for an update like in Febuary or something I readded the victim and I told him how sorry I was for taking his items in the first place and I appolgized to him multiple times and asked if he could forgive me and all he said was \\\" I will forgive you if you give me some keys\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got scammed out of 12 keys you can imagine I was mad. Me not thinking of the consequences that could occur, I find this guy on Reddit named \\\"Riknad0\\\" and I talked to him show him my rep etc to buy keys. I told him I would like to buy 27 keys and He sends me the trade offer for 27 keys and I accept the trade offer. I then message him saying something among these lines \\\" I am sorry bro I would like to apologize for what I have done I know its wrong but I really need these keys back\\\" And he giving me a response saying \\\" Fuck you\\\" And \\\" How could you do this to me?\\\" And I call him (On steam voice chat) I tell him that I am sorry for what I did I decide to give back 12 keys so that I have only scammed 15 at that time. I believe the day after that occurred I told him that I will repay him if he keeps me added so that morning I give him $5.95 via PayPal to repay for 15 keys so that I got my 12 back that I got scammed of in the first place. Then he deletes me off steam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I say I was going to repay him back I check my Steam rep and I see that I got banned. So I decided to add him back and give him him the 12 keys hoping that he can clear it all up and tell the moderator that he had added to unban me from Cash Rep. So I give him back the 12 keys in 2 different trade offers hoping that he can just tell the moderator that nothing ever happened and that he was kidding about me scamming him. And he blocks me after I give the keys back of course because I do believe that I also deserved it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all I kept my promise to give the keys back like I said from the beginning but I still understand that I did wrong doing of scamming him in the first place and being immature. I let my emotions get to me, for the last 12 months I have not been able to appeal my ban, nor go on any trade server\\\/post on reddit so finding trades was very had as I have still found ways to profit (Which is alot harder). I would like to again, if Riknad0 sees this I am sorry for what I have caused to you and I am happy that I was able to give you the keys that I had scammed from you back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope you guys see that I have changed in this last year I commited this offensce when in the summer of going into my freshman year in highschool and I have matured for now fully understanding my wrong doing, in this past year I have scammed no one! and this was the only scam I have ever commited and regret doing it. Just to think that this all started about 12 keys 30 dollars and has probably costed me 5 times as much just blows my mind and once again I can't blame anyone but myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you guys again here at F.O.G for taking everyones appeals from Lethal Zone and escpecially mine I can't thank you guys enough for this I have been waiting and waiting and you have taken ALL of them!

It was a lack of judgement on my part; I was encouraged by a friend to put the scam on my profile, and it was a mistake of mine to listen to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommon tips for a ban appeal include giving back the items to the user(s) you scammed for a better appeal outcome. I did not actually take any of the items of any users, and as shown in the report filed against me, it was only a report against my profile advertising a scam; therefore, there are no items to return to any users. Additionally, all scam advertisements have been removed from my profile.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond of all, it says to provide evidence of my innocence... I am not innocent. I committed a terrible act. I'm dearly sorry for my act, and I hope you will take into account my change of heart when you decide whether to remove the ban or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for reading, and I apologize once more for the scam attempt.\\u200b\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":5,\"views\":180,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":512,\"modificator_id\":512,\"created_at\":\"21.08.2017 06:19:56\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-08-23 13:02:09\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-rejected\\\">Rejected<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"23.08.2017 13:01:43\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"}]}"}
