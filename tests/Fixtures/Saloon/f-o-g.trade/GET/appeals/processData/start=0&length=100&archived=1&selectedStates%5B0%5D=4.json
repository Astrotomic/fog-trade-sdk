So I understand that this looked that I was attempting to scam him, but I promise I wasnt. I thought that it would be a funny joke that he would laugh at. Sadly my english was terrible at this time so I found it difficult to explain that to him via trade messages, because of this he thought I was attempting to scam him and he reported me on SteamREP. I am now banned but I promise that the whole thing was a misunderstanding and I would never try to scam someone of their items, and I have never attempted to scam anyone to this day.

I am now almost 16, still play TF2 after 4,7k hours, and love all of the different Communities that this game has to offer. And not for any amount of money would I consider being excluded from one of my favorites, the Trading Community. I trade, I play the game, I create video content and sell SFM content to other users which pay first, make friends, help others with problems and so much more because of my passion for the game. - I hope I made this clear, because I almost cant express what this means to me. [\\\/i]\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, it was a one time incident, and will always be. I tried it on 3 trading servers \\\/ 1 ctf_2Fort server on only 1 single day, and it was luckily not even successful. By no means do I think the tag(s) were unrightfully applied at the time, but given the time passed since (3,5 years), I want to be able to look forwards - not into the past.\\r\\n\\r\\n- ZEG\\r\\n\\r\\n[List of alts: [url]http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198122827281[\\\/url] - [url]http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198156015672[\\\/url] - [url]http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198021823701[\\\/url] ]\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":4,\"views\":181,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":135,\"modificator_id\":135,\"created_at\":\"16.10.2016 12:37:20\",\"updated_at\":\"2016-10-17 20:23:27\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-accepted\\\">Accepted<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/35\\\/35b3bb702713c7447fb32ca27f81fdfb112b13e5_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198031023338\\\" title=\\\"17.10.2016 20:11:41\\\">Ninja Otter With A Taco<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":48,\"type\":\"Wrong Alt - Alternate account is not my account\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/48\\\">76561197992501832 (\\u0122\\u0126\\u01fe\\u06b4\\u0166)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":null,\"description\":\"I have not done anything to scam anyone and the listed alternate account that is on my SteamRep is not my alternate account, I have never scammed anyone ever.

Regarding the \\\"scam\\\" I admit I ran. However I didn't do this for no reason. I had met the victim on an 100% critical hit trade server on tf2. I had played on this server every single day for the past couple months, before I was banned from it of course. I was well known and had never scammed anyone before. This person I did not recognize from ever being on the server and was challenging people to duels. Being scammed before I wanted to make sure this guy was legit. I checked his profile and it said he had limited account, hadn't been on steam that long, yet he items far more expensive than mine. I figured \\\"what the heck, lets do it\\\", I had never gambled before so I started out with the lowest he would go, a specialized killstreak iron bomber kit which was around a key at the time I believe. I wanted to test him though, as a wise person would want to know his opponent before just gambling it away. He accepted but was quite hasty I might add to get to the actual fight. I noticed this person was not that good. He were playing like someone who didn't know how to play. This didn't make sense though, how could someone bad be in possession of good items and yet be offering to duel for them? I was wary but I didn't think much of it. However when the real fight came he was unstoppable. Here lies the reason I fled. I was ignorant in the ways of gambling and in my eyes I had just been played. In my eyes I had seen someone deliberately play bad to fool me into betting better stuff which he would ultimately win. So I \\\"ran\\\" because I felt that it was an unfair and misleading fight and made a poor decision of expressing that. So in conclusion I admit, I lost and I just want to pay my dues to get this curse of being marked off of me. I never meant to scam and never will again but you also shouldn't go around misleading people to lure them in. I just want the victim to know I was wrong but he should know what he did wasn't right either.\\r\\nThank you for your time.\\u200b[\\\/quote]\\r\\n\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":4,\"views\":610,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":149,\"modificator_id\":149,\"created_at\":\"24.10.2016 03:41:58\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-01-02 15:23:37\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-accepted\\\">Accepted<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"02.01.2017 15:23:31\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":85,\"type\":\"Other \\\/ another reason \",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/85\\\">76561198091484062 (SCHMIDT\\u2122)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":null,\"description\":\"For some reason I was banned from TF2 werehouse.

I had just joined the server when someone typed !bp mungo in chat (which I believe means looking through my backpack) and called me a scammer. I believe his name was shane with alternating uppercase letters and a [SCAMMER] prefix suddenly appeared on my name. Soon every one on the server was calling me a scammer and in a panic i disconnected. I don't know much about trading so I thought it was because I acquired my unusual molten mallard company man (or whatever caused the uproar) through buying it off the steam community market and they couldn't see any trade history or something like that. I try looking up the value of the item on google which lead me to backpack.tf (because maybe the scam meant that i had purchased it way above its intended value) sign-in through steam (for the first time in ever because i was also curious of the implications of being called a scammer would mean on backpack.tf) and find out i was labeled a scammer on steamrep and banned on fortress of gamers. It also labeled me as an alt account of another user (http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/TrustedChurChill\\\/) which honestly surprised me how quickly the person accusing me not only label me as a scammer eventually getting banned from FoG, and linking me to another completely different user on steam.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope this gets to you soon.

In fact, I don't think anyone uses profile rep to access the validity of a person's CSGO trading history. If some people do then I admit, I was sorry for any deception on my part, but I never engaged in any scamming\\\/fraud etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even with this in mind it does not excuse my action that I posted a thread in a CSGO rep group, and then lied about it to try and get out of it. I personally just wanted lots of comments on my profile (as you can see my profile is very neat\\\/I care a lot about its looks) but I admit my action was wrong. I tried to lie in my appeal claiming it wasn't me because I didn't know that I would even be able to get this overturned by admitting the truth that I simply messed up.

It was december 2016, I had just bought myself a good looking inventory of csgo items when one day this dude added me and told me he has a gambeling site. Its been literally 2 years since that happened, therefore I can't remember his steam name.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that, I found the dude to be a bit fishy so I didn't use his site. Yet one day he said that he was looking for a moderator and that If I had some hours to spare \\\/week, I could make some extra skins (as payment for working as a moderator). However I worked for a week and got nothing in return. Before I knew it, he had unfiended me and taken away my 'moderator previlages' from the site.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout this whole ordeal, I never knew the malpractice that took place behind the scenes- I could not have. The site had fake pots taking place, and honestly, I didn't have any way to really verify the legitamicy of the 'huge gambeling pots' or the deposits. I was just a chat mod- the guy who owned the site rarely even spoke to me (for the 7 days that i knew him and his fuckall site). Except for when he was trying to lure me into gambelling my items away.\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand that I'm vv late and without concrete evidence.

Looking back at the incident, I was banned specifically for \\\"intent to scam\\\" by having my name similar to a famous person. I feel like this doesn't make much sense because 1. the person who reported me never even had any contact with me to even know what my intent was and 2. I had the name for about 20-30 minutes as a joke to people in my counter strike game. I never made my profile look like the famous persons, I never changed my picture to match theirs, it was an obvious joke and somebody thought I was genuinely trying to cause harm to people by using the name. Obviously, happening 1610 days ago, I've grown up a lot and looking back it was really stupid, but I think that the issue should be resolved now due to the time that has passed and the lack of concrete evidence of my intentions with the name I was using.

I know that I shouldn't have made the mistake. I can't really add anything else on this one.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Steam Wallet Scam, the one that got referenced in the TF2OP ban is the same as this report: https:\\\/\\\/forums.steamrep.com\\\/threads\\\/report-76561198079334270-tf2-team-fortress-2-items.74656.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe (KiR LorD) added me and tried to lowball me (which I interpreted as a scam attempt at the time) and this turned into a ugly shitstorm where we trolled each other and ended up in he reporting me. After that I added him back to friends and we apologized to each other we agreed that he would step back from the report. He wasn't asking for anything in return and it was basicly was a 180 degree turn from the interaction we had in the past. The report since got Closed (after multiple years of inactivity, in fact I only saw now this has happened)\\r\\n\\r\\nI still own almost all the items I had back in 2014. I didn't try to circumvent the ban, nor to cash out. Trading wasn't primarily about monetary gain for me (altrough i'd lie if i'd say the potential money wasn't appealing to me at all). I genuinely enjoy the game to this day, but to be honest, trading had a very bad impact on my life and mental health and the ban made me finally get away from trading, this is why I only appeal now. Also now I got kinda scared that FoG is going away and my ban will get stuck without the chance of appeal (but that was not the case I quickly found out.)

I had no way to do that and iirc it wasn't even possible to comment on other peoples profiles using newly created accounts, so I ended up getting reported on f-o-g for that ([url]https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/reports\\\/783[\\\/url]) and got banned for \\\"Knowingly assisting scammers\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was stupid of me, it wasn't even funny, it was retarded, \\\"Pranks in da hood\\\" were still a thing at the time so i thought it would be funny but it wasn't at all, I am truly sorry, even though I never scammed or helped to scam anybody, creating these groups was so retarded and pointless.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I ruined my own reputation to get a few laughs from random people on backpack.tf.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00a0\",\"evidence\":\"https:\\\/\\\/i.imgur.com\\\/b16DpE7.png\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/fgg052a3e8f82a7e66345250a58ed7bf\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/eg03fb4gcaf81b50aeeacc5g6beg4c0b\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":4,\"views\":291,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":923,\"modificator_id\":923,\"created_at\":\"19.10.2019 01:03:07\",\"updated_at\":\"2019-11-11 10:51:35\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-accepted\\\">Accepted<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"11.11.2019 10:51:30\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":429,\"type\":\"Other \\\/ another reason \",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/429\\\">76561198235909592 (Nobody)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"| steamname: Photogenic Male | flux\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:165785388]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:0:82892694\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198126051116\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/NobodyCSGO\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198126051116\\r\\n\\r\\n| steamname: Nobody II money.cs\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:366958454]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:0:183479227\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198327224182\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/nobodyrules\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198327224182\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"description\":\"Appealing into response of this appeal:\\u00a0\\r\\n[url]https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/147[\\\/url]\\r\\n\\r\\nBasically a while ago, I was going to repay the owner of this organisation with whatever funds that were chargebacked in the process of my card being used for fraudulent activities as seen in the evidence below.

Gift Wrap scammer May 2nd 2014, 11:48Pm - I scammed the user who went by and still goes by the name Hellcat, for the Team Fortress 2 Item known as Gift Wrap. At the time was worth approximately 1 key. It is now worth 7.22 refined metal as I am writing this. I had a listing for the Non-Tradable Dangeresque, Too? Since this was a Non-Tradable item the buyer in this case\\u00a0Hellcat\\u00a0had to provide me with Gift Wrap as I was not covering it. They traded me the item and Instead of wrapping it, I took the Gift Wrap and immediately after doing so: blocked them on steam. I never bothered trying getting in contact with Hellcat until a month ago since I wasn't trading much, but nowdays I trade a lot more often and its preventing me from trading. I always had the idea of wanting to get my SteamRep mark removed but didn't know the procedure involved.\\u00a0I am unable to get in contact with Hellcat\\u00a0as they have not accepted my friend invitation on steam and blocked me a couple times.\\u00a0I have tried everything I possibly can to get in contact with them - asking my friends to write comments on their steam profile and add them, attempting to send trade offers but they have a private inventory so it does not allow me and adding them myself but to no success. After looking into their profile section and reading the comments, I added a few of their friends and luckily enough one of them accepted me. I spoke with them for a bit and came to this conclusion, in their own words \\\"he believes avoiding other people getting scammed is far more important than revoking scam warning marks\\\" They are acting as if I went to a bank and robbed it when I scammed a Gift Wrap. For a more information: I provided screenshots of our conversation under evidence.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Trading with scammers\\\/alts\\u00a0March 25 2015 - I committed a high-tier trade with a scammer who went by the name \\\"Slushy|CauldronCrones!\\\" Since I was fairly new to trading at the time, I was unaware of them being a marked scammer and was unaware there was a rule on backpack.tf stating if you traded with marked scammers that it would warrant you a warning\\\/tag depending on how many times you traded. In this case, I only committed one high-tier trade and I am assuming was granted a caution tag. I am fairly certain the rules about trading with scammers was a lot more strict compared to the rules now, but I am not 100% certain. Regardless, trading with a marked scammer 7 years ago is not worthy of a ban anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would like to also note I have 3 negative trust factors on my backpack.tf profile two of them NOT being valid (first two), despite reporting the negative ratings, they are still on my backpack.tf profile. I just thought this was worth mentioning in case this was used against me as a way of saying that I have not changed or I'm still a scammer.\\r\\n\\r\\nGOLD_KING left feedback about a year ago:\\\"The man tried to cheat by offering a disgusting offer! DO NOT TRADE WITH THIS BAD PERSON'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 My take: Simply offering on someone's item is not considered a scam or by any means 'cheating' as he refered to it as. I offered a Vivid Plasma Glengarry Bonnet which was priced at 17.5 keys on Backpack.tf, however this was an outdated pricing. There was a sell order listing for 25 keys and I was using that was reference for the pricing. I offered on their Max's Severed Head, which at the time was roughly 21-22 keys. I remember communicating with this invidivual and found it particulary difficult due to the language barier. English was not their first language. People lowball on items all the time but does the other person go out of their way to report the individual on backpack.tf? No.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nKF left feedback\\u00a07 years ago: \\\"This guy before tried to scam my unusual for a old price unusual.He want to use this\\u00a0[url]http:\\\/\\\/backpack.tf\\\/vote\\\/id\\\/52a643544dd7b83c7d8b4568[\\\/url]\\u00a0to trade my 4.75bud unusual hat with 2earbud with some key.However,that not really 6.18-7.06 bud. when i see that suggestion explain only cost 2~4 earbud . so this scammer tried to scam about the range.He think me don't know about that.don't trade with him!DONT TRUST HIM\\\"\\r\\nMy take: KF was using an out dated price suggestion for pricing my item instead of looking at the active sell orders. There was a listing at the time of my unusual being sold for\\u00a06.18-7.06 buds as mentioned, which is why I used that price range as reference. He did not supply any proof of the sell order listings, our chat logs or even the name of his own unusual. His only sort of \\\"proof\\\" is an outdated price suggestion which means nothing. No proof what so ever, should be deleted.\\r\\n\\r\\nPr1nce left feedback from 7 years ago: \\\"gift wrap scammer, do not trade or trust in any circumstance\\\"\\r\\nMy take: Valid.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Conclusion - I was initially given a caution for scamming\\u00a0Hellcat on May 2nd 2014, 11:48Pm and later SteamRep marked on the March 25 2015 for committing a high-tier trade with 'Slushy|CauldronCrones!'. It has now been over 2535 days of my ban and I have reflected on my older self and since then learnt some valuable life lessons and grown so much as a person. I would like to be given a second chance to do the right thing. I am a changed person and I do not like being compared to my older self. I do not agree with being marked as a scammer since this incident was minor considering what happened. I should be given a caution tag at the very least. I know that I have not repayed Hellcat, but there is literally no way for me to do it and if I could do it, I would in a heart beat.

I remember he would trade and I would mainly surf on the server as I wasn't big on peer-to-peer trading at the time due to the obsession with profit-only trades and I personally preferred gambling websites and trading bots. If I remember correctly the name of the server was Alias. As the original ban shows via name logs, I changed my name to impersonate a player named Enstage for less than two hours while on this server. As I remember I did this to gain clout within the server. However, due to my young age and my knowledge that this friend would for a short time attempt to (but never successfully) scam people, it is very possible that I attempted to act as a middle man. I do not think this was actually the case but if it was I never gained anything from it (nor did the ex-friend) and I truly apologise for these actions. Even if I did not attempt to defraud people it was still wrong of me to impersonate a trusted individual. I wish I had a more clear memory of the event however it was a long time ago and neither I nor anyone I can find from around the time appears to have any screenshots of this.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after this event, I got banned from the server and just carried on playing cs and trading with bots as normal (I wasn't a trader anyway so I didn't really care that I'd been banned from the server and didn't even realise I had a steamrep ban until I started looking into trade-ups during around late 2021). Thankfully the gambling shortly stopped around a year after this incident. Also, shortly after this, the ex-friend started playing cs:go games with hacks and got VAC banned, and left the community entirely. We also went our separate ways after school.\\r\\n\\r\\nI now want to iterate that even though this friend bought me into the shady world, I hold myself accountable for all of my actions. I was the one who changed my profile and looking back at it, I provided him with tools that he would use to scam. For this, I am ashamed of myself. Thankfully in hindsight, I can see what I did was wrong and can confidently say I am a better and more mature person. I am not looking for complete removal of the ban tag but hopefully a reduction (not going to lie mainly so I can use the csgo float database). If you decide you do not wish to take this action I completely understand as I am aware I have not been able to provide much evidence and ultimately it's your rules and your decision. All I can say is that since August 2016 I have never impersonated anyone and never been involved in any scam attempts. I still do not trade and do not intend to trade I just wish to be able to use the float database for trade-ups.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn evidence, I have attached screenshots of my trades from between when the report was made and when the ban was made in order to show no items were gained by myself from anyone who wasn't involved, only trades between friends, bots, and one guy who traded a knife for half my inventory (this trade is one of only three peer-to-peer trades with strangers during my entire 6 years of cs). I have also attached the original name changelogs.
