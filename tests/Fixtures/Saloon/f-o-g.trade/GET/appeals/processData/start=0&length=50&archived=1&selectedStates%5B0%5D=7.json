The use of impersonating Schmed was purely for trolling\\\/ pranking a group of scammers.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo begin, I was in a skype call with my friend [url=http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198078739355]Twnty[\\\/url] (http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198078739355) when he was contacted by a Scammer\\\/Trader named Dazed ( I cant find his profile nor profile link as they do not exist anymore) wanting to trader his knife for twnty's knife.\\r\\nDuring Twnty's conversation with Dazed on steam, Dazed, had said that he wanted to verify Twnty's knife's legitimacy through the use of a \\\"Steam Admin\\\" so as to prevent the trade of any glitched \\\/ bugged items being exchanged. This immedietly alerted me and Twnty that the person contacting him was a scammer and we decided to play along acting dumb.\\r\\nSoon after, Dazed had linked Twnty a link of a person named \\\"Gara\\\" an impersontor of an actual middleman\\\/ trade admin and provided Twnty this link -\\u00a0[url]https:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/GaraOfficialsteamAdmin1\\\/[\\\/url] . This link of which no longer works due to the scammer changing his profile URL after this debacle.\\u00a0\\r\\nTwnty does have video evidence of this occuring and I will provide the link to it later on.\\r\\nAfter getting added on steam by Gara, the three of them get into a group chat containing Dazed,Gara and Twnty.\\u00a0\\r\\nAt this point, I decide to troll the two scammers by impersonating an admin named Schmed, the person I was accused of impersonating. I would like to point out at this point that my impersonation of the admin was never used for any malicious or scamming intent and was purely for pranking\\\/trolling the scammers who had messaged my friend, Twnty.\\r\\nAfter that, I joined the group chat with the scammers and trolled them before they finally left when they realized that I was a fake.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, yes, I had impersonated Schmed, a trade midldeman\\\/admin, albeit not intended for any malicious purposes and just for fun to prank\\\/troll a bunch of scammers who had contacted me and my friend. To further make it obvious that my profile was a fake and not intended to be a serious impersonation, I had changed my of the profiles details to make it look like so.\\r\\nAn example would be the changing of \\\"Lethal \\u00a0Zone Trade\\\" to \\\"Abu Hajar Traders\\\" and another example was the changing of the SteamRep profile link to Schmeds profile to instead link to my profile. This would have shown a \\\"No Special status\\\" tag instead of a \\\"Middleman\\\/Administrator\\\" tag.This was done to prevent people from thinking that I was a real admin and to show obvious tell-tale signs that my profile impersonation was a joke.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I finish, should you require any additional information about the subject, you may contact [url=http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198078739355]Twnty[\\\/url] at his profile page so that he can substantiate my claims. To reiterate, I did not use the impersonated profile for any bad\\\/malicious intents and was purely for entertainment albeit a rule offence. I was before myself a trader and understand what its like to have been scammed and I would never scam or participate in any such activities. I would also like to point out that I wouldnt risk getting my account banned in any form because it is my main and only active account which contains all my games and is of great value to me.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nTo finish, I would like to thank you for considering my appeal and I would like to stress my innocence in this situation.\",\"evidence\":\"http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/297gc76f9397adf1ff4757d84ab8ge17\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":47,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":200,\"modificator_id\":200,\"created_at\":\"30.11.2016 09:00:42\",\"updated_at\":\"2016-12-01 10:13:19\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"01.12.2016 10:13:11\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":88,\"type\":\"Friend\\\/Family - My account was abused by a family member or friend\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/88\\\">76561198168035148 (slayerkey)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":null,\"description\":\"Add-On: I can't trade with this ban on my account cause people always call me out my brother has not been on his account in 3 months after his laptop broke and this ban was recent.

I also made a Ban Appeal back in May 2016 which got rejected because I didn't had all the information I needed to and because of my \\\"story changed too many times\\\", I'm really sorry for that. Then I made a break from CS GO until now, where I came back to play because I got motivated by the Eleague Major and my friends. And now, as I started to play again, I don't want that people look on my SteamRep profile and see:\\\"Oh, this guy is a scammer\\\", because I'm not.\\r\\nThis is my story so far:\\u00a0I got this ban for impersonating \\\"Someone\\\" on my old Steam account, I really regret this, because I was doing this out of rage caused by a scammer who scammed me with impersonating \\\"Someone\\\". I know that was so silly and now over a year later I think I can stand above that:\\\"I got scammed because I was too dumb and don't have to seek for payback at all costs\\\". After that my account was listed in a mass report in the FoG-Forum and the ban followed. To be honest I tried to scam two people with but they didn't fall for that. After I calmed down, the next day or so, I decided to make up my mind, create a new Steam-Account and get out of CS GO-Trading but I still wanted to play the game, so I bought it and I'm still playing on that account until now. After a while I bought myself some skins again and wanted to gamble\\\/bet with them. The problem was that Steam created the Mobile-Authentification for website-log in (this \\\"code thing\\\" to log in on CSGL and other 3rd party sites) so I had to make a dicision. I headed back to my old Steam-Account deleted my phone number from there so that I can use it on my new account and set the profile to private (to say I've abandoned it). I knew that I can't get access to this account anymore but that was ok for me because I wanted to leave it behind. After some time again I realised I got banned on my new account also, that was reallly frustrating but I said to myself:\\\"You already lost one account to your silliness, don't do this again!\\\", that worked I just took it how it was. Then I made a break from CS because I lost the motivation and also my rejected appeal was a reason, partly. Now I'm back and I want to start clear, without bans, without any bad reputation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was as honest as I can be and I hope you understand my situation.

The payments to 'major' companies were excempted because those payments were paid physicaly but payments that were to 'nonmajor' companies\\\/online companies were reversed\\\/chargebacked as the unauthorized payments were done through gateways such as PayPal and Stripe.

Basically our credit card which was used to donate to FoG was hijacked and was used to make unauthorized payments via gateways like PayPal, G2A and Stripe. As a result of this, payments used on the card were chargebacked if they were not authorized by our bank. Most of them being payments made online. This chargebacked money from: Steam, Payment Gateways and other things.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow I have evidence from PayPal Stating that this information is actually true and that they verified it as well from Steam Support verifying this. This clearly shows that the chargebacks were out of my control. PayPal Clearly said that 'Your card issuer notified us that your card was used without your permission.'

I Argee Most Of The Reports I Did Wrong And I Did This Because I Was Very Poor And Even Through That Is Not An Excuse I Did What I Did Because I Wasn't Growing In The Team Fortress 2 Economy And I Wanted To Grow More. I Use To Spycrab People And Run Away If I Lost. Now I Will Admit I Knew What I Was Doing And I Feel Bad Now Because I Used People For My Gain. Now Recently I Received A Report By Somebody Nammed Vincent Who Clearly Reported Me Under False Context And I Was Very Mad How His Report Went Through Even Though He Had Little To No Proof And He Said I Scammed Him A Key Even Though I Have My Trade History Which Shows I Gave Him The Key 11 Minutes After I Added Him As A Friend. If I Could Figure Out Evidence Or Something I Will Be Able To Prove This To You. Now Almost All My Other Reports Was From 8 Months Ago When My Backpack Was Around 100-200 Ref And I Was Just Trying To Make A Living. Well I Spent Alot Of Money On This Game Recently Just So I Am Able To Become Wealthy Like Those Around Me. Since I Am Quite Wealthy All Those I Scammed From All The Reports I Readded Them And Gave Them A Key. I Screenshoted It And If You Tell Me How To Use Evidence Its On My Google Cloud Account. I Did This So I Am Able To Redeem Myself Hopefully For Scamming Because I Really Want To Join Trade\\\/Unusual Servers Without Being Looked Down At Because I Have The Scammer Tag. This Scammer Tag Really Effects Me Because Recently I Was Force To Sell My 150 Key Unusual Taunt (Square Dance 72 Effect) For Like 70 Keys Because I Could Literally Find No One To Trade With Me Because I Am Banned From So Many Servers. I Feel Like I Learn A Lesson About Scamming And Truely If You Deny This Which I Hope You Do Not Because I Really Want To Not Be Looked Down Towards Because Of This Simple Tag. I Cannot\\\/Do Not Have Any Excuses Other Then I Was In The Wrong And I Relieze That Now. I Made A Group Called Moonmans Prison Cult And In That Group With Around 80 Members I Do Givaways From Keys-Unusuals-Aussies And I Can't Say I Opened This Group Because I Wanted To Do Good. But I Can Say I Opened This Group So I Can Have Friends And Not Be Seen As Some Kind Of Worthless Scammer. Thank You And I Hope You Atleast Reconsider Taking 1 Or 2 Of These Scammer Reports Away.

But I got scammed by this guy : http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/oaisjdfoincvo (I didn't reported him cuz I didn't know about SR, I have all proofs if you need, this guy is trade banned). I banned myself because of depression last time, I remembered about this happening and tried to end with trading, gambling and gaming items. This actually happened. But I unboxed an unusual on banned account!!! (http:\\\/\\\/backpack.tf\\\/item\\\/5585001381 is proof)\\u00a0and this occasion gave me hope. After ban I tried to appeal, but I lied insane because I scared that the truth is very silly and shameful. All in all, I hope that this appeal will be accepted. I am insane liar and I count only on caution because I want to start trading and playing on FoG servers.\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S.
