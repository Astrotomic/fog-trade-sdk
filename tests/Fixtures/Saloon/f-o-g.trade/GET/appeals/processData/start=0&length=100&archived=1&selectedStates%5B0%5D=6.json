So I require him to wait for a 7 days before I could transfer him the knife for inspection as he wanted to know weather it's a real or the duplica. He then refuse to wait and he wanted to find a middle man to do the job for him but I refuses his offer and next thing I know my account was being hijacked and I couldn't log into it and the reason I know it is the same guy that hijacked\\u00a0my account is becuase he uses the same name as the trader. After what happen, I created a new account and try to emailed my old account to ask him to return my account but he started using my new steam account name to scamme people and probably that's the reason my current account is being mark as a FoG scammer.

I didn't do any research on said profile, not knowing that it was an Administrator for SteamRep, or one for any site at all. I can admit to having the same alias, the part I beg to differ of, is the \\\"attempted fraud\\\" accusation, as said on my SteamRep profile, which is currently why I have a bad reputation. Though I had the same name as this Admin, (Which I will give a picture of his profile, as well as my previous aliases [I know, I have a really edgy profile]) I did not attempt to commit any fraud, or any other crime involved. My name was the same as this Admin because it was a joke, with a group of friends I play CS:GO with a lot. The joke, or \\\"meme\\\" as we call it, was that we all had changed our names to something similar, and mine just so happened to be \\\"Sailing\\\", while others had \\\"Flying\\\" or \\\"Driving\\\", because we as a group, were all about jokes. My friend Cameron explained that he 'knew' someone that had the name \\\"Sailing\\\" when he saw the rest of the group and I in a TeamSpeak channel, and thought it would be funny if I was replicating that guy. Being as stupid as I am, I changed my name without researching who it was, as well as my picture, because that was a kick to said friends of mine. I'm requesting this appeal and acceptance, because I, myself would not like to be accused wrongfully for my actions, as I will do research before doing anything as even close to stupid as changing my Steam name, like I do every other week. I'd like to thank whoever is or was reading this for their time, as it is a long story, and it is a very stupid occurrence.\",\"evidence\":\"https:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/fcb5af92177c9e9g3a96g713fgdcdc1c\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/9cg8f0e9c84d211dc4eccg02cb26e41f\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/7b073ed7a6000af79178cd4ag16d59b8\\r\\n\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":6,\"views\":63,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":259,\"modificator_id\":259,\"created_at\":\"17.01.2017 21:37:22\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-01-18 10:57:12\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-invalid\\\">Invalid<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"18.01.2017 10:57:07\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":127,\"type\":\"Mistake - Admin misunderstood evidence or made a mistake\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/127\\\">76561198178097475 (\\u2665 :D)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":null,\"description\":\"Tio bro, u gonna have to trust me man, those are not mine.....

It's been almost 4 years since I was banned for scamming a person using a steam wallet transfer. The real reason behind me scamming the person was that I had been scammed by someone using a phishing link. So, being a kid(almost 14 or 15 years old), I was really angry and I thought of scamming someone just to get back what I lost(which was probably the worst decision I've ever made). However, after being reported for scamming, I returned some expensive CSGO skin back to the person I scammed(Proof of trade in Evidence). I, now have realised my mistake, and also have moved on and learnt a lot in life. I've been back in the community after almost 2 years or so now and have just started some causal gaming with my friends. I haven't touched trading for the past 3 years. If there's anything that I need to provide, please let me know.\\u00a0\\r\\nThank You.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alt's I've mentioned aren't all mine(only 3 are).

I really made a mistake as a teenager who got greedy seeing every one with cool items and i thought why not try a quick scam i saw on YouTube what could go wrong ? Well, everything went wrong i tried scamming 3 people on the same day\\u00a0 i never successfully scammed anyone i really didn't... i appealed 6 or 7 months ago and it got denied i really didn't know what to do my rep ruined my account i don't even trade anymore i stopped trading years ago..\\r\\ni'm now a different person i realize that what i did years ago was a huge mistake and im truly sorry... i wish i can say that im gonna return the stolen items but i didn't scam anyone so i can't do so .I never ever tried or thought about doing what i did again i left that life behind me i don't even need items anymore i have a job now and i buy everything with my own money. It truly breaks my heart when\\u00a0 i see people who actually scammed getting their appeals approved and yet im left with a heart breaking denial.\\r\\nThank you for your time, this is gonna be my last appeal im sorry for everything im sorry for trying to scam im sorry im just sorry\\r\\nRegards\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":6,\"views\":83,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":728,\"modificator_id\":728,\"created_at\":\"26.02.2019 15:03:11\",\"updated_at\":\"2019-02-26 15:06:51\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-invalid\\\">Invalid<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"26.02.2019 15:06:46\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":406,\"type\":\"Change of Heart\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/406\\\">76561198073330387 (speedy1kh)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"| steamname: ByeBye\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:245219781]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:1:122609890\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198205485509\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/lolggfamkillmyself\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198205485509\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"description\":\"Hello people at FoG, my name is Kane or SPEEDYKH.
