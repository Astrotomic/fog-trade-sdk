The use of impersonating Schmed was purely for trolling\\\/ pranking a group of scammers.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo begin, I was in a skype call with my friend [url=http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198078739355]Twnty[\\\/url] (http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198078739355) when he was contacted by a Scammer\\\/Trader named Dazed ( I cant find his profile nor profile link as they do not exist anymore) wanting to trader his knife for twnty's knife.\\r\\nDuring Twnty's conversation with Dazed on steam, Dazed, had said that he wanted to verify Twnty's knife's legitimacy through the use of a \\\"Steam Admin\\\" so as to prevent the trade of any glitched \\\/ bugged items being exchanged. This immedietly alerted me and Twnty that the person contacting him was a scammer and we decided to play along acting dumb.\\r\\nSoon after, Dazed had linked Twnty a link of a person named \\\"Gara\\\" an impersontor of an actual middleman\\\/ trade admin and provided Twnty this link -\\u00a0[url]https:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/GaraOfficialsteamAdmin1\\\/[\\\/url] . This link of which no longer works due to the scammer changing his profile URL after this debacle.\\u00a0\\r\\nTwnty does have video evidence of this occuring and I will provide the link to it later on.\\r\\nAfter getting added on steam by Gara, the three of them get into a group chat containing Dazed,Gara and Twnty.\\u00a0\\r\\nAt this point, I decide to troll the two scammers by impersonating an admin named Schmed, the person I was accused of impersonating. I would like to point out at this point that my impersonation of the admin was never used for any malicious or scamming intent and was purely for pranking\\\/trolling the scammers who had messaged my friend, Twnty.\\r\\nAfter that, I joined the group chat with the scammers and trolled them before they finally left when they realized that I was a fake.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, yes, I had impersonated Schmed, a trade midldeman\\\/admin, albeit not intended for any malicious purposes and just for fun to prank\\\/troll a bunch of scammers who had contacted me and my friend. To further make it obvious that my profile was a fake and not intended to be a serious impersonation, I had changed my of the profiles details to make it look like so.\\r\\nAn example would be the changing of \\\"Lethal \\u00a0Zone Trade\\\" to \\\"Abu Hajar Traders\\\" and another example was the changing of the SteamRep profile link to Schmeds profile to instead link to my profile. This would have shown a \\\"No Special status\\\" tag instead of a \\\"Middleman\\\/Administrator\\\" tag.This was done to prevent people from thinking that I was a real admin and to show obvious tell-tale signs that my profile impersonation was a joke.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I finish, should you require any additional information about the subject, you may contact [url=http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198078739355]Twnty[\\\/url] at his profile page so that he can substantiate my claims. To reiterate, I did not use the impersonated profile for any bad\\\/malicious intents and was purely for entertainment albeit a rule offence. I was before myself a trader and understand what its like to have been scammed and I would never scam or participate in any such activities. I would also like to point out that I wouldnt risk getting my account banned in any form because it is my main and only active account which contains all my games and is of great value to me.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nTo finish, I would like to thank you for considering my appeal and I would like to stress my innocence in this situation.\",\"evidence\":\"http:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/297gc76f9397adf1ff4757d84ab8ge17\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":45,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":200,\"modificator_id\":200,\"created_at\":\"30.11.2016 09:00:42\",\"updated_at\":\"2016-12-01 10:13:19\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"01.12.2016 10:13:11\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":88,\"type\":\"Friend\\\/Family - My account was abused by a family member or friend\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/88\\\">76561198168035148 (slayerkey)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":null,\"description\":\"Add-On: I can't trade with this ban on my account cause people always call me out my brother has not been on his account in 3 months after his laptop broke and this ban was recent.

I also made a Ban Appeal back in May 2016 which got rejected because I didn't had all the information I needed to and because of my \\\"story changed too many times\\\", I'm really sorry for that. Then I made a break from CS GO until now, where I came back to play because I got motivated by the Eleague Major and my friends. And now, as I started to play again, I don't want that people look on my SteamRep profile and see:\\\"Oh, this guy is a scammer\\\", because I'm not.\\r\\nThis is my story so far:\\u00a0I got this ban for impersonating \\\"Someone\\\" on my old Steam account, I really regret this, because I was doing this out of rage caused by a scammer who scammed me with impersonating \\\"Someone\\\". I know that was so silly and now over a year later I think I can stand above that:\\\"I got scammed because I was too dumb and don't have to seek for payback at all costs\\\". After that my account was listed in a mass report in the FoG-Forum and the ban followed. To be honest I tried to scam two people with but they didn't fall for that. After I calmed down, the next day or so, I decided to make up my mind, create a new Steam-Account and get out of CS GO-Trading but I still wanted to play the game, so I bought it and I'm still playing on that account until now. After a while I bought myself some skins again and wanted to gamble\\\/bet with them. The problem was that Steam created the Mobile-Authentification for website-log in (this \\\"code thing\\\" to log in on CSGL and other 3rd party sites) so I had to make a dicision. I headed back to my old Steam-Account deleted my phone number from there so that I can use it on my new account and set the profile to private (to say I've abandoned it). I knew that I can't get access to this account anymore but that was ok for me because I wanted to leave it behind. After some time again I realised I got banned on my new account also, that was reallly frustrating but I said to myself:\\\"You already lost one account to your silliness, don't do this again!\\\", that worked I just took it how it was. Then I made a break from CS because I lost the motivation and also my rejected appeal was a reason, partly. Now I'm back and I want to start clear, without bans, without any bad reputation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was as honest as I can be and I hope you understand my situation.

The payments to 'major' companies were excempted because those payments were paid physicaly but payments that were to 'nonmajor' companies\\\/online companies were reversed\\\/chargebacked as the unauthorized payments were done through gateways such as PayPal and Stripe.

This chargebacked money from: Steam, Payment Gateways and other things.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow I have evidence from PayPal Stating that this information is actually true and that they verified it as well from Steam Support verifying this. This clearly shows that the chargebacks were out of my control. PayPal Clearly said that 'Your card issuer notified us that your card was used without your permission.'

I Argee Most Of The Reports I Did Wrong And I Did This Because I Was Very Poor And Even Through That Is Not An Excuse I Did What I Did Because I Wasn't Growing In The Team Fortress 2 Economy And I Wanted To Grow More. I Use To Spycrab People And Run Away If I Lost. Now I Will Admit I Knew What I Was Doing And I Feel Bad Now Because I Used People For My Gain. Now Recently I Received A Report By Somebody Nammed Vincent Who Clearly Reported Me Under False Context And I Was Very Mad How His Report Went Through Even Though He Had Little To No Proof And He Said I Scammed Him A Key Even Though I Have My Trade History Which Shows I Gave Him The Key 11 Minutes After I Added Him As A Friend. If I Could Figure Out Evidence Or Something I Will Be Able To Prove This To You. Now Almost All My Other Reports Was From 8 Months Ago When My Backpack Was Around 100-200 Ref And I Was Just Trying To Make A Living. Well I Spent Alot Of Money On This Game Recently Just So I Am Able To Become Wealthy Like Those Around Me. Since I Am Quite Wealthy All Those I Scammed From All The Reports I Readded Them And Gave Them A Key. I Screenshoted It And If You Tell Me How To Use Evidence Its On My Google Cloud Account. I Did This So I Am Able To Redeem Myself Hopefully For Scamming Because I Really Want To Join Trade\\\/Unusual Servers Without Being Looked Down At Because I Have The Scammer Tag. This Scammer Tag Really Effects Me Because Recently I Was Force To Sell My 150 Key Unusual Taunt (Square Dance 72 Effect) For Like 70 Keys Because I Could Literally Find No One To Trade With Me Because I Am Banned From So Many Servers. I Feel Like I Learn A Lesson About Scamming And Truely If You Deny This Which I Hope You Do Not Because I Really Want To Not Be Looked Down Towards Because Of This Simple Tag. I Cannot\\\/Do Not Have Any Excuses Other Then I Was In The Wrong And I Relieze That Now. I Made A Group Called Moonmans Prison Cult And In That Group With Around 80 Members I Do Givaways From Keys-Unusuals-Aussies And I Can't Say I Opened This Group Because I Wanted To Do Good. But I Can Say I Opened This Group So I Can Have Friends And Not Be Seen As Some Kind Of Worthless Scammer. Thank You And I Hope You Atleast Reconsider Taking 1 Or 2 Of These Scammer Reports Away.

But I unboxed an unusual on banned account!!! (http:\\\/\\\/backpack.tf\\\/item\\\/5585001381 is proof)\\u00a0and this occasion gave me hope. After ban I tried to appeal, but I lied insane because I scared that the truth is very silly and shameful. All in all, I hope that this appeal will be accepted.

Im so sorry for doing the actions i did, i was Young and dumb, i did not understand it was wrong and well. I guess if this doesn't get accepted there's nothing to do... I regret this and i wanna repay the guys who i scammed or so but its too late now :\\\/ I hope you understand and give me another chance or atleast help me... It has been more than 1 and a half year since i got banned. 1 of the alts are my brother the other is mine. I should get my tagged remove or downgraded because im not about that life anymore and i just wanna go back to normal and trade on server that are big and be a known big professional trader, which is my dream and i atleast want another chance and try. I started scamming because i thought it was cool and didn't know that this could happend and well lets say i didn't think much about anything, i realise that this is bad and how i hurt people from doing this, I realise if this would happend to me i would be sad to but i did not realise that back in the day where i scammed because i was dumb... I was known trader even with my tag and i have gotten ALOT of Legit +Reps on my steam acc. But people dont respect me the same. I wish to put listnings on Outpost and such but i cant, and one day i hope to be a big rich trader and have a nice sortet BP. When i try to scrap bank or trade bots for fast things, they dont accept me because i have a tag, and it ruins my whole TF2 expierence as i want to trade alot, and i know it my problem and things and as i said i regret it.

I cross my heart none of this will ever happen of me again. I want my steamrep scammer ban gone because I am a trustworthy guy and I usually trade quite often with CSGO items.

I was cocky at the time and thought I was able to outsmart the 'moderators' with tricks and lies but I have really since then grown up. Honestly, this was a big lesson for me when people could see what I did when I was younger. I have since then very much changed and with my deepest condolences, like to apologise for what I did back in the day. I scammed, I did it but I would really love a second chance to prove my worth. I had no idea what I was thinking at the time of the period back in 2015. I am now 16, and have mentally and physically changed and maybe hope that you can understand that we do a lot of things when we are younger and regret them as we grow up, this really was one of those things to me and I with all my respect deeply apologise for all that I have ever done in the past in this community...\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":58,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":428,\"modificator_id\":428,\"created_at\":\"14.07.2017 13:11:21\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-07-14 13:42:54\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"14.07.2017 13:42:48\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":231,\"type\":\"Wrong Alt - Alternate account is not my account\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/231\\\">76561198273741958 (tony | WTB>Karambit BP)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"| steamname: I don't use or have any jesus christ.\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:313476230]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:0:156738115\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198273741958\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/NoAltsLmao\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198273741958\",\"description\":\"you have an active appeal with R3ZIONIC where he's talking about sharing accounts, giving accounts to friends, and he can get his tag removed of course!!!! but the \\\"alts\\\" that aren't even mine, but a friends that i logged into once won't get unbanned? like what? that's just stupid.

I really felt bad then and quickly ended up taking down my scripts from the internet as good as I could but at that time I was already banned for sharing it. After I took my script down, I promised myself to never do that anymore to anyone. Now, some time later, according to the policies of Valve every Gambling Site was taken down and there is not even a possible way for me to do that anymore. Thats why I think that no danger is going off of me and since Gambling Sites dont really exist anymore (at least in the sizes that they existed before) and I changed my opinion on scamming someone 180 degrees I have the right to appeal for an unban. I admit the scam I did and since I experienced being the victim instead of the scammer I will never send any betting scripts to anyone out there.

The report of that incident can be seen here:\\u00a0[url]https:\\\/\\\/forums.f-o-g.eu\\\/threads\\\/76561198026967134-%E1%B4%BE%E1%B4%AC%E1%B4%BA-that-spu-ftc.5637\\\/[\\\/url] . The scammer that I have traded with does not have a scammer tag anymore and since I don't plan on trading at all any time soon I wish to get that report removed as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother thing as well is that the alt account listed in SR is not mine, but was my little cousin's account.

I claimed in my appeal that I was subjected to account and network hijacking. It was all a lie. Not only did I attempt to lie to Steam Support but also on my appeal. The reason for my VAC ban was; I downloaded hacks off a site called MPGH prior to the 12-12-2015 and attempted to play competetive games over the course of a few days to attempt to gain a higher rank. I gained a feeling of power as I was playing better for other players who I'd usually play with. I got to the point of no going back. I started using the hacks insanely and neglecting the fact that it was cheating and that people could tell. So 13-12-2015 I logged onto my Steam with a VAC ban on my account for CS:GO.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the 20-01-2016, I was subjected to being scammed on the site \\\"CSGODouble.com\\\" I myself were victim to a scam piece of code which would send all your credits to a certain other Steam user on the site CSGODouble. I then gained the mindset that a code as simple as the one I used could give myself possible gain. So I went to Google to discover methods of editing code's to do as what happened to me. On the 20-01-2016 I edited the code, placed my SteamID into it and then pasted it to Pastebin under a guest. I then copied the Pastebin link and posted it around claiming insane profit. I state here now that I did not once gain from doing the code. I never used the credits to my advantage nor did I ever receive items from CSGODouble.com. I honestly don't understand why I even bothered to post the code around when I was VAC banned, meaning I couldn't trade CS:GO items.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow to clearing up my appeal for this account:\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/77\\r\\n| steamname: Jax\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:109210441]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:1:54605220\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198069476169\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/JAX010800\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198069476169\\r\\n\\r\\nI stated this in my appeal \\\" Decemeber 2015 my network office network was hijacked and in following my steam acount was too. I was on holidays during the time my network was hijacked and my computer was comprimised. I left my computer on as I had bots for my own trading site going. \\\", which was completely false. I was still living at home with my parents (I know quite sad) and were in no financial situation to have a 'network office.' As well I was not on holidays and it was me the one who was in control of my account. I also definetly did not have a trading site going as I am merely not smart enough hence my stupid act to scam people for CSGODouble.com credits. I was asked to provide my Steam Support ticket screenshots to provide proof of my account being hijacked. I did so, even though the things stated by myself in the Support ticket was in true false and incorrect information. I lied to Steam Support in order to somehow remove my VAC. Dumb of my to try as I was the one who put myself in that situation. Later in my appeal I stated \\\"\\u00a0I have never posted betting scripts, I'm unsure as to how that would be posted on my behalf. My email was hacked on Jan 20th, this may of gave access to my Steam account due to the passwords being the same for both accounts before I reset them both. \\\" This was false, I posted the betting scam scripts for self gain and I also lied about my email being hacked. I inspect elemented a previous email of my account being hacked to provide the correct date for me to state my email was hacked. So in all for the appeal. I admit to lying multiple times to attempt to remove the ban on FoG.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nClearing the appeal for alternate account:\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/105\\r\\n| steamname: ayJaxSpraynPray\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:307566682]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:0:153783341\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198267832410\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/ayJaxSpraynPray\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198267832410\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know if I can appeal that account here but I will do so and if neccessary I will create a new appeal for that account.\\u00a0 I created the appeal on 14-12-2016 after discovering my account had been linked to my main banned account. I created this new acount to play CS:GO with my IRL friends for fun. Nothing competively. Now for my appeal; I stated \\\"\\u00a0My last apppeal was me being legit about my account being hacked. \\\" This was utterly incorrect and false. I was in control of my account and there was nothing to do with hacking involved with my account. I also said \\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0I didn't open the appeal on my other account with the purpose to lie. \\\" which again was incorrect as I did lie multiple times trying to claim innocence. Very dumb of me may I add. Finally in my appeal I stated \\\"\\u00a0As for the CSGODouble code script hack or whatever it was, I'm sorry to those who it affected. I really didn't take my actions as serious when it come to gaming and now after getting back into CS it makes it very difficult to get somewhere with it. Alot of people don't want to trade or even game with me. \\\" I do claim I committed the betting scam script, but it contradicts everything I said in my main appeal as I claimed I didn't do it, so yes I did screw up.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, I hope that this can clear everything up and that I can somewhat be revoked of my FoG tags. Now this appeal may not be successful but in all, I am glad to finally clear myself for all that has been kept inside. I am pretty saddened at what I did and I hope that this is enough proof. I am willing to provide as much proof as possible to seek forgiveness within the community. I have also apologised to the sir who reported me in the first place and hope that I can further contact him to seek forgiveness.\\r\\n\\r\\nKind Regards,\\r\\nJax\\r\\n\\u00a0\",\"evidence\":\"JAX010800 Appeal:\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/ca7d407e67bda4219b4655aa88aba9dg\\r\\n\\r\\nayJaxSprayNPray Appeal:\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/3b67ee33ccdd0a519f3feeg2b60cefbb\\r\\n\\r\\nMe claiming insane profit on a Steam group 20-01-2016.\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/79da864cd287e6ag81baf8gfa089d57b\\r\\n\\r\\nProof of no trades receiving from CSGODouble.com\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/d748f25a03g20gad1c6f8cdabda8f484\\r\\n\\r\\nProof of CS:GO VAC ban 1.\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/a61bdd84gbf2665e9bfbg218f19c0191\\r\\n\\r\\nProof of CS:GO VAC ban 2.\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/adb9bc61c6c2g53ede778fg8feb3f8bd\\r\\n\\r\\nFalse Steam Support ticket 1.\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/cfa4e97af19a1362gbf3eaec7d7538ga\\r\\n\\r\\nFalse Steam Support ticket 2.\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/1g8cefdfegf2cbbbdcc7a27fb7bb2g6g\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternate account appeal on FoG.\\r\\nhttps:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/0a7g8c8g2bd7c0fb4dd8fb5b3f92dfda\\r\\n\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":7,\"views\":534,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":187,\"modificator_id\":187,\"created_at\":\"01.02.2018 10:47:54\",\"updated_at\":\"2018-02-01 16:34:46\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-archived\\\">Archived<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/0b\\\/0b7ac2b67f05050b6ee73dbc7cdeda5aa9afb070_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198024654687\\\" title=\\\"01.02.2018 16:34:31\\\">Tio Jos\\u00e9 das Vacas<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"}]}"}
