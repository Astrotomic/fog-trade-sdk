So from the start of this incident, I had an AWP Asiimov Battle-Scarred and I was kind of getting bored with it, so I was just searching up about new CSGO jackpot sites, then I found this (which turned out to be a douchebag scam site). I wasn't paying attention to anything except for finding a new site to play around with (got bored with csgobubble coinflip). When I first entered this site, after logging in with Steam, a message popped out, saying that if you add \\\"skins-roll.com\\\" to your name, it gives you 7% extra win rate, and I did exactly that. After that, I went ahead and deposited, thinking that I had a chance to win. At the end, I lost my AWP.However, after I lost (against a bunch of fake bets), I did not take \\\"skins-roll.com\\\" off my Steam name because I was applying for chat moderator on that site (I did not know that it was a scam site until recent times). Then one of the \\\"moderators\\\" contacted me, saying that they would hire me, and the pay was $50 per month (I wanted to earn back what I lost on skins-roll.com). Being an ignorant idiot I was back then, I decided to take the \\\"job\\\" offer without thinking about anything.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\u00a0I believe that after I accpeted the fake job offer was when people starting finally reporting this site. I also heard some information about skins-roll's legitimacy at the time, but I was, again, being ignorant, and decided to keep the name\\u00a0tag on. About 5 days later, every one of the \\\"moderators\\\" that I added on steam blocked and unfriended me, and that is when I knew I messed up. 2 days later, I got banned.\\r\\n\\u00a0First of all, before blaming anything else (including the site), I just want to say sorry for being an ignorant person. I was acting like an idiot and did not think about anything being a scam at all. I learned my lesson and will be more careful when I am looking for csgo related sites on the internet.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\u00a0Now, onto the site part. I have never been a real \\\"admin\\\" on this site. I might have looked like one because when I got to be a \\\"chat moderator\\\", the scammers told me to add different informations on my profile (including advertisements), which I did. However, I have never got control to \\\"control games and pots\\\" and thus never got actual skins.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\u00a0Attached screenshot is the trade that confirms my deposit on skins-roll.com (I also added it to your file hosting site)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you guys have anything to ask, please do contact me because I am so fustrated by this incident and I want to get rid of it. Sorry for taking your time and thank you for helping me out.\",\"evidence\":\"https:\\\/\\\/files.f-o-g.eu\\\/1fgdbe80aa1d150eace014fd75856f2g\\r\\n\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":5,\"views\":613,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":513,\"modificator_id\":513,\"created_at\":\"22.08.2017 06:56:40\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-09-24 12:20:26\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-rejected\\\">Rejected<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/avatars.akamai.steamstatic.com\\\/431c6ff582fc1529ac602154c513703d18428c90_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198021339988\\\" title=\\\"24.09.2017 12:19:52\\\">Edward<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":254,\"type\":\"Other \\\/ another reason \",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/254\\\">76561198382060144 (Sehuashi)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"\",\"description\":\"Well Basicly i was banned for\\u00a0Staff of fake CS:GO gambling site and i yes that is true i was admin on a fake gambling site but at the time i didnt know it was fake! they just told me if i wanted to be admin and i said yes then they just said edit your profile like ours so we get people on the site and then we pay u each month and i just said ok!\\r\\n\\r\\ni wasnt into the fake gambling site at all they just told me to do it and i said sure cus i tought it was legit and i wanted some free money.\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":5,\"views\":376,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":517,\"modificator_id\":517,\"created_at\":\"02.09.2017 20:27:29\",\"updated_at\":\"2017-09-03 19:47:54\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-rejected\\\">Rejected<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/avatars.akamai.steamstatic.com\\\/431c6ff582fc1529ac602154c513703d18428c90_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198021339988\\\" title=\\\"03.09.2017 19:47:21\\\">Edward<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":259,\"type\":\"Wrong Alt - Alternate account is not my account\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/259\\\">76561198073330387 (SPEEDYKH)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"| steamname: ByeBye\\r\\n| steam3ID: [U:1:245219781]\\r\\n| steamID32: STEAM_0:1:122609890\\r\\n| steamID64: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198205485509\\r\\n| customURL: http:\\\/\\\/steamcommunity.com\\\/id\\\/lolggfamkillmyself\\\/\\r\\n| steamrep: http:\\\/\\\/steamrep.com\\\/profiles\\\/76561198205485509\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"description\":\"Hello, 2 years ago I got banned for being a \\\"Scammer\\\" and only just recently I wanted to get back into trading with a friend so I thought I would go deeper into this ban and find out why I was marked as a \\\"Scammer\\\" and found out that this \\\"Alt Account\\\" isn't actually my Alt account plus I don't even own a Alt account.

At the time, I was under a lot of pressure to scam as my friends were also doing so and making lots of money. I thought, if they don't get caught, I won't get caught either and with that mentality, I began to scam. Now, many days later, I have finally come to realise how immoral this was and I believe I deserve a second chance. I would really appreciate it if you removed my SteamRep FoG scammer tag as I have changed my attitude and now think that I can maturely act within the trading community. Please reply with any questions you wish to ask. I have paid back the one member that I had scammed previously.

After turning 18 and actually working I have felt so bad because I understand what it's like to get your paycheck and then to have the money lost because a shitty person took it. I cannot find this users steam and I would seriously go and repay him with compensation but I can't find it. I see I have another account banned and that was denied when I got banned. I still am saying that is NOT my account. I tried everything I could to explain that it's my brother hence why we both are high levels and have loads of hours in different games on the same days and different steam friends. I seriously am not sure what proof was given that said we both were the same person when the only proof is IP because we live in same house, some steam groups from when we played Source, and I got banned on the sub Reddit as it required a steam profile so I linked his just to bypass the system.

Fairly new to steam,TF2 and traiding.\\r\\nI stumbled apon a server. I was young like i said and i said to myself. What could hapen if i try to steal someones items? If a admin comes i log off. Yeah what a good idea! Wrong. I went in,said i was selling noclip for hats. Of course nobody fell for it,so no items where stolen at the moment. Somebody reported me on steam rep and not long after i got a tag. Now i didin't notice the tag after a while. I never knew what steamrep is atm. When i tried to join any traiding server,i couldn't said i was banned. And like that constantly until i found out what steam rep is. As i made a appeal my english was really bad. It was denied. Couldn't really explain anyone that i would NEVER scamm again. So im back, after almost 4 years. trying to appeal one last time for the ban.

At the age of 12 I used to twitch stream, and I got a good amount a money from a friend through a donation (like 25-40$). With this money I was going to buy a AK skin off the market, but my friend stopped me. He told me he had bought skins directly from people, and that you could get much better deals. I took his advice, and sought after a good skin. When I finally saw someone that had one I wanted, I contacted them through steam. I had heard of people getting scammed, so when she told me to go first I was worried. So what I did was look up the username on Google as so. \\\"Is (username) a scammer?\\\" I know this was stupid, but at the time it was completely plausible in my mind. I did not find much, so I assumed I was in the clear. I went into my paypal. Here is where I messed up. Unlike the mobile version, to an unintelligent 11 year old, the desktop site is not simple. I was lost and did not know how to send money. I was clicking buttons and hyperlinks all over the page, until I landed on a page that said \\\"Send Invoice\\\". I assumed this was where I had to be (not knowing what an invoice was) because I saw a place to type in the amount of money to send, as well as an email. After sending what I thought was $20, I told her that I had sent it. I got no response. I thought I got scammed. Skipping forward to know, I was going to send one of my PUBG skins to an IRL friend. We had closed the deal, for cash at school the next day. He came back telling me that he could not trust me because I was banned on steamrep.com. I was shocked, for a while I did not even know why even after seeing the reason.

I READ THE RULES, and they said if I found new evidence that I could apply for a second appeal. For what happened,\\r\\nI had used a CSGODouble (if you remember, it was a gambling site) script that would take peoples coins if they copied it into the html console. I did this because it happened to me so I got mad. \\r\\nI will say again like I did in my last appeal, I never made any money off of this. My appeal was denied because there was no way to prove it. In this appeal I will try to prove that I did not make\\r\\nany money from this. Of course, the pastebin link to the script was taken down when I submitted my first appeal, so that hasn't been an issue. Also the site is down so I couldn't use it anyway. I should state\\r\\nthat I think I should be unbanned because this is the ONLY time I have ever tried something malicious to make money. I have never tried to scam anyone besides from this, and never will. My proof is in\\r\\nmy trade\\\/market history on steam. First, I will show my trade history. Keep in mind this website was deposit\\\/trade SKINS ONLY. There was no way for me to get paypal\\\/bitcoin money, etc. This scam attempt\\r\\nhappened on April 19, 2016. In my trade history, you can see that there are no trades at all on April 19, with the closest trades being April 15 and April 22. You can also see that I am actually depositing\\r\\nmy own skins, not withdrawing other skins. I will also post the entire next page to show that I am constantly \\\"trading\\\" with the website, withdrawing items of equal value to what I deposit. Next I will\\r\\nshow my market history. Market history doesn't show year, but I started at the end (or start technically) since my account was made in September 2015, and went to April of the next year. You can see that there\\r\\nis also nothing on April 19, with the closest ones being April 17 and April 22. This is as close as I can get to proving that I didn't get anything out of this. I know this is 2 years later, and I also\\r\\ndon't really trade anymore since CS:GO trading is kind of dead, but I just really don't like having a SteamRep ban for something that didn't even give me anything. As for why I'm doing this so much later,\\r\\nthere are 2 reason. One is that this kind of just dawned on me as a way to possibly prove it, and two is that I haven't attempted any scams SINCE my ban, which was 2 years ago. I feel like this proves\\r\\nsomething, but I don't know if it helps my case at all.

So when I tried to login in dota2lounge I found out that I got banned on a website called steamrep and Fog. Turns out that my current account which is Clyde9 is banned because it was friends with my previous steam account which is cabbage. So regarding my previous account, I gave it to my acquaintance in my school before when I quit dota2 because they wanted it 'cause it can use the community market in steam (note: i didnt sell it, i just gave it up, \\\"i have nothing much to do with that account anyway\\\" was my thought that time). And they used that account in some shady business like scamming csgo items and they edited that accounts profile to be very informative with various links to look legit. I saw that when thye showed it off to me.I didn't really care about what they did to my account that time. But I came back to dota2 and used my smurf account\\\/2nd accout which is what I am using right now.\\r\\n\\u00a0and then I didn't know I got banned in your website\\\/community.

I was naive and broken up about my loss and didn't realize the impact scamming could also have on another person like it did on me.\\u00a0\",\"evidence\":\"\",\"assignee_id\":null,\"state_id\":5,\"views\":795,\"locked\":1,\"creator_id\":968,\"modificator_id\":968,\"created_at\":\"03.03.2020 01:31:50\",\"updated_at\":\"2020-03-05 01:30:52\",\"state\":\"<span class=\\\"label label-rejected\\\">Rejected<\\\/span>\",\"assignee\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/fe\\\/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_full.jpg\\\"\\n                                     alt=\\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> Unassigned<\\\/div>\",\"last_reply\":\"<div style=\\\"display:inline-block;white-space: nowrap;\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\\\/steamcommunity\\\/public\\\/images\\\/avatars\\\/c4\\\/c4f8f16d543d9e952d0d14a2683404f5ae165ed6_full.jpg\\\" alt = \\\"No Avatar\\\" class=\\\"user-avatar-small\\\"> \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/profiles\\\/76561198059316053\\\" title=\\\"05.03.2020 01:30:48\\\">Sniper Noob<\\\/a><\\\/div>\"},{\"id\":446,\"type\":\"Mistake - Admin misunderstood evidence or made a mistake\",\"appellant\":\"<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/f-o-g.trade\\\/appeals\\\/446\\\">76561198162498684 (Wetard)<\\\/a>\",\"alts\":\"\",\"description\":\"You guys are actual fucking nazis lmaoo\\r\\nStop taking this so fucking seriously.

Recently i have started to play Dota 2 again since i had a nostalgia call from back in the day.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before all this has happened, let me make a quick summary of how i got the ban from FoG and, from a few years back, the Caution tag.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of this started back in 2014 i think when i was in middle school. My friends got me into Team Fortress 2 and quickly found people along the way to play with. I usually spent my time as a kid on a public trade server or on a deathrun map on TF2. Back then, i used to look and see people that had many sorts of cosmetics and my brain as a kid wished that i could have some of those one day (I have never added money in the game at that time since i was too little). After I kept seeing people and my friends that got new cosmetics, I felt a little left out, with nothing to beat them at (meaning I was that bad at the game, not even the skill worked for me)\\r\\n\\r\\nI decided to \\\"cook up\\\" some schemes of stealing the items from the people that had better cosmetics than me (For those that played tf2, i was a gibus player) and take them for myself. I would look up online for methods of scamming and, back in 2014-2015, the scamming was crashing down on, at least of what i've heard of. There was this method that i used with faking a valve copyright mark and saying in a trade offer that money will be credited in the victim's account if he accepted the trade. And there it started.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the way, i managed to get some of those hats on the first account\\u00a076561198121330260 but got it trade banned soon after it started. I think it lasted for 2 to 3 weeks, although im not sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then i created the secound account to scam\\u00a076561198155078726\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, i managed to steal some items as well but soon after i started to scam, i got reported and BANNED on FoG's old website (Before FoG there was a different name from what i recall) and got busted preety quick.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime passed, and i quitted scamming because i moved to Dota 2 in late 2015 and there were no trades that i could do.\\u00a0\\r\\nAfter a while, it was quiet. Some time in 2016-2017 i think i tried appealing here on FoG or on their old website for a ban removal with the Change of Heart reason (kinda ironic) because i had another nostalgia call and played tf2 again for a while and wanted to trade with the 3rd party bots for items and cosmetics.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, they got my ban removed but left me with this CAUTION tag since then. And then it went quiet again, for a long time.\\r\\nCAUTION tag did not stop me to trade with the bots and i was alright with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, what happened with it you might wonder. Well... as i said in the first paragraph, i have gotten into Dota 2 again, and for good and would like to start sell some old skins for some real cash and trade fairly. This tag will pin a red flag on me for what i did, and it is fair for the other person that i trade with, but i am confident that i've changed.\\u00a0\\r\\n\\r\\nI am a Second Year Student at the time of writing this and i feel ashamed for what i did. It would be great to have this removed since it stains my reputation in gamer's community. With the free time i have i would like to also appeal for administration in different communities, trying to help with what i can, but i havent made my mind yet with this one.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlright. For the admin that will read this,\\u00a0 i am sorry that this is as long as it is, but would like to discuss more if needed. I might have slipped some details with no intention of doing so and i want a full clear with the situation. Would highly appreciate if this appeal will be considered, but that is not my decision. Keep up the great work with managing appeals.

I was pretty confused because I haven't been interested in trading or the like in several years, and I just got back into cs very recently. Looking at the information, it says I was banned 1,900 days ago, which is 5.2 years. I would have been 13 years old at the time, and I have no doubt that I may have done some stupid stuff related to steam skins and the like. I'm writing this appeal hoping you would lift this tag from me, as I have not done anything that warrants such a tag in half a decade. I would really appreciate it if you could lift this from me so I could play on the servers my friends frequent and maybe participate in the occasional cs go trade (I promise nothing malicious in nature, that's for sure.) I hope you can help me with this, and I apologize for anything stupid I did as a kid. As for evidence, I don't have much to add except the number of days ago I was banned.
